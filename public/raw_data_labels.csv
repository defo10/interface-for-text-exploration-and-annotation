Then President Obama warned people about coastal flooding due to “global ing” but obviously by his actions does not believe anything about such imminent ocean waters rising.

Ice is less dense than water but yet displaces water more... so actually, the water levels will go down slightly. If we have more ice, it will cause water levels to rise.   	33	6

2020-01-02 02:05:57	jp	The British Met. Office has downgraded it's estimates of both global ing and sea level rise. This of course was not announced on the TV. Most ice in the world is floating on the sea, hence submarines can pop up at the pole. Get a glass and half fill it with ice. Pour water into the glass until the ice floats.  the level of the water on the glass. Wait until the ice melts. The level does not change. Archimrdes. Actually it will at sea by 2.6% of the volume of the ice, rather better than 100% used in some 'scientific papers'. Too much money tied up in global ing - IT MUST HAPPEN.  	31	6

2019-12-20 13:38:17	BoN	@Burnard Maoangarp You are partly right. Look at Archimedes postulate ( buoyancy, ice density, fresh watter density, sea watter density, .... ). Your example is true for floating ice on fresh watter. Melting of all North pole floating ice wouldn't rise sea level ( only a bit, because of the difference in its density ). Danger is melting of continental Antarctic and  ice shields. But it is hardly possible in a short time. Mankind has time enough move to higher place. But Antarctica isn't melting ( But Thwaites Glacier may be melted from below by geothermal heat, researchers at the Institute for Geophysics, The University of Texas,  says. )  	5	6

Fill it with water. Put your two ice cubes in it. Make sure tre floating and let them melt. Now two ice cubs to the ratio of water is way more ice then we have on this planet. Now let it melt.

The snow pack in the Rockies are at 3x the average. The models say its getting er, and that is true for some areas, but data taken at the source on the ground says its getting colder.

If you don't believe me, pop a couple of ice cubes into a glass of water and note the water level as the ice melts. Ice on land is a different matter, that will effect sea level. However in all this talk of ice melting, the fact that the ice in Antarctica is growing is ignored!  	5	6

2019-11-21 22:44:07	Mike Smallwood	Nonsense video. The Earth is not a solid rock. It's composed of floating plate tectonics, which exhibit displacement as the loads upon them shift.   As glaciers melt, tlleviate the load on their respective plate and the land that composes the plate rises as the ice melts off and flows into the ocean, wherein the plates that compose the ocean floors simultaneous sink lower as the load of water increases above them.   Ocean surface elevations to that of the dry lands they surround are not uniformly fixed and where those ocean elevations rise in one area of the Earths suface, the opposite will occure elsewhere.

The earth heats up and cools down over time until it reaches a high temperature tipping point resulting in demenissed ocean currents which brings on a prolonged period of colder temperatures. With ing temperatures we can always move crop production northward as opposed to being out right screwed in the event of an ice age. It's global cooling not ing we sould worry about altough we sould still work to slow the current rate of ing if possible. Getting a hold on population growth would be a good place to start.  	31	6

2019-11-12 01:08:35	cliff bird	ice caps have always been melting and reforming throughout the history of earth. Long before humans came along. Fact is if it wasnt for CO2 emissions we would be a lot hotter now. CO2 stops the oxygene in the atmosphere from igniting and catching fire.         There has been several mass extintion events on earth 2 involved humans where the human race was nearly wiped out and become extinct. That had nothing to do with man made CO2 emisions it was due to lack of CO2.   CO2 is a fire suppresant and stops oyxgene igniting. It also blocks most of the harmful raditaion from the sun heating up earth too much.         Most of the sea level rises is man made and nothing to do with climate change. Its called water displacement. Every boat and ship on the water cause sea levels to rise. Every bit of rubbish dumped in the sea causes it to rise. Every bit of land reclaimed from the sea causes sea levels to rise.   So for 1 country to build an artificial island in the sea causes another island somewhere else in the world to sink under water. Then they blame it on climate change instead of what they did.         Stop dumping stuff in the sea. Stop making ships bigger and bigger and stop reclaiming land and sea levels will stop rising.   Taking every ship of the seas will cause sea levels to drop by several feet.         Maybe u learnt about water displacement at school maybe u didnt. Simple experiment u can do at home. Fill the bath with water to the top. Then climb in and the water will rise due to ur body displacing the water as the water has nowhere to go it will get higher till it overflows the bath and goes all over the floor. same thing happens when stuff is put on or in the oceans.         IE a supertanker when empty doesnt displace as much water as when its full.   Ships r measuerd by tons of water they displace. So the more tons the more water has to go somewhere else which means sea levels rise Maybe only a few inches but for every ship that could mean several feet overall.  	31	2

2019-11-11 21:03:22	Carol Dee	Try this experiment. Fill a cup with Ice or snow, and let it stand and melt. Does the water get bigger or smaller? If it got bigger then that view of the land disappearing under water would be true, but if it "shrinks", then your view is all wrong! Fake news.... The earth will not go under water.....  	5	6

The city of Suez is only 36 ft above current sea levels and Cairo is only 75 ft above with nothing much to stop the waters from the Med. Giza is only 98 ft. above sea level, yet in the video none of these areas seem to be 'underwater'.         So, if tre claiming a 'worldwide' rise of 216 feet, then why is it that their best friends of Global Warming (elite Democrats like Obama) are BUYING BEACHFRONT PROPERTIES??  	31	3
2019-11-05 17:16:31	Kasey B	I feel that this doesn't do good justice to the full effects if this happened. If all ice melted it would cause the sea level to rise, thusly raising the elevation of the sea level, which would cause the tributaries and their own tributaries to rise in effect as well. Tre just showing the coastlines when they should also be showing that the Mississippi river, Nile river, Amazon River, and the like would all expand and rise as well, causing swampland to come about, and many more issues. Severe flooding inland would occur. This is just a depiction of something that is not as severe to lull public opinion to see it as not as serious as it actually could become  	31	6

2019-10-27 21:00:33	Riggald	CO2 in the air traps heat. (We've known exactly how much for 170 years).   More CO2 in the air traps more heat.   More heat makes things hotter.   The hotter things get, the more ice melts.   The more ice melts, the higher the sea level gets.   So far, 8"/200mm higher, and 1/7th" each year.   8,000 years ago it was 4degC colder. Ice ts like 's covered North  all the way down to New York City.   There was so much ice, the Bering Strait and the North Sea were dry land.   Then it ed. Most of the ice melted.   The seas rose.   It took almost 10,000 years to  by those 4degC.   Humanity has raised the temperature by 1degC in just 100 years.  	31	2

2019-10-19 16:42:52	C R.	Ok kiddies, now let’s use real science such as was taught in 7th grade.   Ice displaces it’s own weight by volume. In other s, water expands when it changes from a liquid to a solid. It also becomes buoyant because the density changes. The amount of water is the same in liquid or solid form. Therefore the level of the water remains the same.   Try this easy experiment yourself:   1 transparent glass, preferably clear and smooth surface.   1 piece of masking tape (1-2” long) or other non transparent tape.   Fill the glass 90% with any style ice.   Now fill the glass with water up to about 1” from the top.   Place the edge of the tape right at the edge of the water level.   Let it sit overnight on your counter.   In the morning check the water level to the tape.   Keep in mind the ice to water ratio in your glass compared to earth.  	33	6
2019-11-07 22:53:26	C R.	 well I don’t claim to be a scientist, mostly a tax payer! I am old enough to remember the mid 70s when all the “scientists” were going on about global freezing. Within a few decades we were going to freeze to death! It was publicized in Time and NewsWeek and other magazines etc. “Don’t put away your parka” was one headline. Here we are decades later and the earth did not freeze over. Funny how there has always been only two things to combat “man made climate change”. More and more regulations of which the cost is ALWAYS passed on to the consumer and higher and higher taxes. The indisputable facts are we can no more cause or stop climate change than we can control the sun. The touting of man made climate change is the trogon horse to bilk people into panic mode so we better do something and fast! The earth has always had climate change and always will. Long before we ever started burning “fossil fuels”. Co2 is a fantastic gas to have! All vegetation uses it for food and then gives back O2. And that’s bad? Irregardless of the ice above or below the water line, try the ice water experiment. As I said before, the ice to water ratio is way beyond the amount of ice on the earth including ice above the earths water level. Give it a try!  	20	2
2019-11-07 03:04:53	Xavier Lauzac	 If more ice is above than below, the water level will rise.  	33	6
2019-11-07 03:03:04	C R.	 I don’t know if I would agree with that but I also don’t believe it makes a difference how much ice is above or below the water line. Did you try the glass of ice water experiment? Once again, the ratio of ice in the glass vs water is many times the ratio of earth. Just try it.  	33	6
2019-11-06 23:48:43	Xavier Lauzac	No it doesn’t. Most of earth’s ice is above water.  	33	6

2019-10-12 19:27:39	J M	Great, now think about where the coast lines were during the last ice and before the younger dryas. During the younger dryas there was about a 400 ft rise in sea level, why this is important is most of the world population lives on the coast lines or off major rivers. The evidence or missing link to early human history is most definetly sitting below sea level off the new coast lines that were formed at that time. At this time there was a mass extintion event in the 's where roughly 90% of the megafauna were wiped out and there was a mass bioburning event that left a black mat layer which is very similar to the KT boundary formed during the dinosaurs extinction event.  	31	6

We all now know, based on science facts of the tectonic shifts in the history of our planet, & both poles have melted before, along with Ice Ages. However, based on human activity, & now over human population, we're now accelerating that natural planetary process. Humans will now see the global devastating effects of Global ing. My grandkids will see the last drop of fossil fuels being used up, along with another nuclear dirty bomb detonate somewhere on our planet, and that won't be the worse of shit that going to happen. What will bring humanity to its knees will be a virus/fungus/bacterium as a direct result of Global ing. Fact: On both poles, there is horrible virus/bacterium/funguses that have been dormant for over 140,000 years, & because of Global ing, they're "waking-up" from a type of cryogenic deep freeze, & we humans have rang the dinner bell. Another "Black Plague" will hit humanity, & we'll not see it coming. Just like a Left Hook in Boxing, & it will be devastating! The CDC now has permanent stations in both Poles where CDC Scientist are looking @ really bad shit that the human eye has never seen before under a microscope, & we have no solutions to the horrific Blitz headed our way.

2019-10-07 23:41:59	David Willis	@ Medieval Warm Period (900–1300 AD) The Medieval Warm Period (MWP) was a time of  climate from about 900–1300 AD, when global temperatures were somewhat er than at present. Temperatures in the GISP2 ice core were about 2°F (1°C) er than modern temperatures  	20	2
2019-10-07 23:40:57	David Willis	@ So, in fact, the last ice age hasn't ended yet! Scientists call this ice age the Pleistocene Ice Age. It has been going on since about 2.5 million years ago (and some think that it's actually part of an even longer ice age that started as many as 40 million years ago).  	20	6
2019-10-07 23:39:51	David Willis	@ most recent Ice Age occurred then, as glaciers covered huge parts of the planet Earth. There have been at least five documented major ice ages during the 4.6 billion years since the Earth was formed — and most likely many more before humans came on the scene about 2.3 million years ago.Aug 29, 2017  	31	6
2019-10-07 23:38:49	David Willis	@ But in terms of the long history of the Earth we are actually still in an overarching ice age period - known as the Quaternary glaciation - which has been going for the last 2.6 million years. At the moment, the Earth is just in a slightly er period, an interglacial  	31	2
2019-10-07 23:38:02	David Willis	@ These data suggest that an equally long duration should be inferred for the current interglacial period as well. Work in progress on ls Hole data for the period 60,000 to 5,000 years ago indicates that current interglacial temperature conditions may have already persisted for 17,000 years.  	31	2
2019-10-07 23:36:52	David Willis	@ interglacial period (or alternatively interglacial, interglaciation) is a geological interval of er global average temperature lasting thousands of years that separates consecutive glacial periods within an ice age. The current Holocene interglacial began at the end of the Pleistocene, about 11,700 years ago.  	31	2
2019-10-07 23:34:33	David Willis	@ Earth's ice caps were completely melted from: -The early Ediacaran period (about 620 million years ago) to the late Ordovician (about 445 million years ago), -The early Silurian period (about 444 million years ago) through the  period (about 350 million years ago) -The early Triassic period (240 million years ago) through the early Miocene epoch (until about 15 million years ago) It is very unlikely that the Earth's southern hemisphere (Antarctic) ice cap will melt for the foreseeable future. The  ice cap may melt, though.  	31	6

2019-09-27 00:38:03	OLD SCHOOL	Hey climate guys-   Earth s and ice caps melt-   1.Billionaires will find their beach front mansions under water-new beach is inland where poor people live- billionaires must pay poor people huge amounts for the beach property- hooray for wealth redistribution   2\. Sea levels rise- whale habitat increases- and their population expands- Yay for whales   3\. More ocean means more fish which means more seafood for the poor - Go poor people!!   4\. Expansion of sea surface means more rainfall and more fresh water-Down with droughts!!   5\. More rainfall means deserts across the globe become arable farmland and we have a huge surplus of low cost food- great for previously starving, but now overweight Africans.   6\. melted glaciers mean Siberia, N. , Antarctica,  and Iceland are now open for people to move and live there- Yes to homesteading.   7\. Huge reserves of oil and natural gas are discovered under Antarctica- oil becomes cheaper than water- Mid east oil is no longer important and conflicts cease- Save the Camels!!  	31	2
2019-09-26 23:25:22	xtvst	If all the ice melt, we will die cooked pretty soon after that. While talking about climate change, it seems that everyone thinks the only consequence is the rise of the sea level. Glaciers works as huge temperature stabilizers for the planet due to the property that to melt 1g of water 80 calories are taken.  	31	6

2019-09-26 14:56:59	Bill Meck	Is this actually true? Or is it "just a little lie to move the ball forward "? Ice in the ocean, mostly the North Pole and the ice ts around Antarctica, wouldn't raise ocean levels if melted. An ice cube in a glass of water doesn't raise the level when it melts. That leaves mostly  and Antarctica.  is MUCH smaller than wall maps depict. Also I read that the surface of the oceans is so vast, they could easily absorb all of the melted ice without much rising. So I'm not saying this video is false. But I have my doubts.  	5	6

2019-09-24 22:07:14	Frederick Spurlin	There is a sucker born every minute. Sea level changes over relatively recent geologic and human history demonstrate that alarmist claims do not withstand scrutiny. Sea levels rose significantly after the last ice age, fell during the Little Ice Age, and have been rising again since the LIA ended around 1850. In fact, Roman Empire and Medieval port cities are now miles from the Mediterranean, because sea levels actually fell during the Little Ice Age.   During the deepest part of the last ice age, known as the Wisconsin, sea levels were about 400 feet lower than at present. As Earth emerged from the Wisconsin some 18,000 years ago and the massive ice ts started to melt, sea levels began rising. Rapid sea level rise during the “meltwater pulse phase,” about 15,000 years ago, was roughly five meters (16 feet) per century – but then slowed significantly since the Holocene Climate Optimum, about 8,000 years ago. The rate of sea level rise today is about 7 inches a century, and we are still a 100 some feet below pre LIA sea levels, will todays sea side property be underwater? Yes, in about 600 years. The arrogance it takes to think humans can stop Mother Nature's course or even influence it is only outdone by the stupidity of thinking Mother Nature will listen to politicians offering money and suddenly make the world have a perpetual and perfect spring days of weather for everyone everywhere and always.  	31	2
2019-09-24 07:41:54	whorghoul puzio	whats with all the fear mongering , the ice will never melt over night and flood the planet , it'll take years to do so and water evaporates faster in hotter temperatures , also 1000's of years ago there was no ice anywhere on the planet before the ice age that we are still coming out of is why is is getting slightly er .think the planet will flood in the next 15 years or less like they keep pushing on us , go to any bank on any coast and see about how they feel about 30 year mortgages of homes or other property that has a potential wipe out if the ice melts ,if tre absolutely against anyone taking a 30 year mortgage then you are right and I am wrong , but if they still do 30 year mortgages then you are wrong because you know how banks love giving away money they can never recover because you lost your home to global flooding . think about that  	31	6

It's the same effect as digging a hole and then refilling it with the dirt you just dug out of it... it'll never look the way it did when you started.   The ocean will never be filled till it overflows. I get my facts from the Bible.   Scientists don't know s***.

The occurrence certainly wouldn’t happen over night and our overly comfortable lives and its comfortable attachment to its passed on learned history would certainly be given that added kick of an incentive, so our dependency on an ignorance towards they least catered for would hopefully alter, at least for a little while.

2019-09-16 13:14:33	LSuschena	The arctic ice pack floats on water, so if it were to melt totally, which will never happen, sea level will actually drop.   Most of  ice pack is surrounded by mountains, more than likely if it were to melt, the ocean would flow into .   It’s reported the 250 billion tons of the 26,500,000 billion tons of ice on Antarctica melted last year. At that rate it will take 1,006 years for all the ice on Antarctica to melt. However, in the year previous, they reported Antarctic ice actually increased, but their new g conveniently doesn’t show it.   250 billion tons is 0.000,009 of the total ice pack. The amount of change isn’t even measurable with any accuracy.  	31	6

Ice is condensed water it takes up an equivalent amount of  when thawed out. Try this with your fourth grade children, fill a bowl with ice just over the top of the bowl, then add water to the brim of the bowl, one good size chunk of ice will work, let it thaw out and melt.   You will see what this malarkey is all about. Sea levels near large cities are not rising, it's an old thing known to farmers as soil compaction.   According to NASA, yes the same clowns that have given us climate change and other such fanciful religious nonsense of technology sea levels are fairly stable..  	31	6

2019-09-08 17:17:25	Fc3s808	 eventually we would have to move 100% of the population off of earth. It won’t happen in our lifetime but it will happen. As for banning greenhouse emissions.

2019-09-08 16:43:25	engrtun	, , can we colonize  to inhabit even 20% of world’s population? I think our best option is gradually decrease and then ban greenhouse emissions along with afforesting on emergency basis. It’s not something we human aren’t capable of, it’s just matter of priorities of politicians.  	3	1
2019-09-08 04:13:49	Fc3s808	Colonizing  is a better option. At current rate sea level rises 2 feet per year. It’ll take 100 years for the levels to rise 200 feet. Even if all the ice caps melted there would still be land to inhabit. ,  Bezo, NASA, China and India all have aspirations to go back to  with intentions to colonize, as early as 2024.thats less the time with less the capital. Also we need a second home in case something happens here for example a super volcano eruption or a giant meteor.  	5	1

2019-09-02 00:26:29	Nick Houck	Not very precise, all glacial rivers and lakes would flood inland and or just dry up are fresh water. Depending on speed if event. And don't forget about tidal and rotation factors. Like the fact that the earth is egg shaped and more water is held at the poles due to rotation. If I had the recourses I would build a sunamie pod on steroids. A real arc like a bullet proof anfibious RV that could survive the worst sea states and then have some resources on board to help with starting over. Because the truth is that we dont know what will happen with crust displacement or ice and sea level. So building a bunker at altitude might not even be reliable.   We know that past events have happened quick enough to freeze mammals in place and raise the sea level at least 400 ft. In short order. Meaning we would at least need to prepare for a winter lasting a decade before we could even think about growing any food. But hell we survived it before we can do it again.  	31	3

2019-08-31 18:55:08	Doug Warner	welcome to reality humans can not stop the ing of the earth because earth has always had a cycle based on a variable of factors like tilting of the earth , sunspots and frequency, permafrost and plant life, continental glaciation. We are part of the earth like animals and we will adapt to changes and cities on low elevation will be swallowed up as history has showed us .  	20	2
2019-09-06 23:33:12	Doug Warner	@ Oh my you have sure got the propaganda down very well . See here there were periods of when the earth was ing in fact several times how did that happen when human activity was not on this earth and not human caused CO2. By the way it was the ing of the earth in the last ice age which we are still in .Not that many humans . You should really research the other side so you can be well informed which either might change your mind or call men and women that have studied this subject of climate a whole lot more than you or me . So far All I here from your side is omissions lies and very wrong climate modeling that does not see reality as it is on the ground now.. Also please answer my question on why the two people in  that say global ing is real and we are going to see oceans rise ....why are they ignoring their truth. I know I won't get an answer because you people never can give an answer when faced with logical truth ....you all need to learn how to critically think ...not independently think but critically think that means listen to both sides without bias  	20	2
2019-09-05 16:27:20	Muon Neutrino	: It’s this simple Doug. CO2 traps heat in the atmosphere. There’s more CO2 in the atmosphere than can be produced by natural processes. The level of CO2 started to rise with the beginning of the industrial revolution. Man engaged in the industrial revolution. Therefore, man caused the rise of CO2 in the atmosphere.  	20	2
2019-09-04 22:55:00	Doug Warner	@ I guess building or buying a Mansion on the ocean by your climate change guru Al gorithim and Obmmer isn't a contradiction or hypocrisy. Why would they do this when the planet is in such dire need of less CO2. Hasa says the planet is greening with more vegetation than it has ever been. Don't we need more CO2 for the plant which produce oxygen. Could it be that there is more water vapor in the air which is causing a more heated atmosphere. What you really need to do is get more information from other scientist that will show you a better truth like climate changes all the time but what is behind the change . I have to tell you bubba less information does not make for an informed person and remember AOC was a bartender babe just 2 yrs ago and not a scientist. It' sad to see so many people stop researching and don't have the curiosity to say I need more info to form a much better opinion  	20	2
2019-09-03 21:17:20	Muon Neutrino	This time the ing isn’t caused by axial tilt. That would be evident in the length of the seasons not to mention GPS indications. It’s caused by excessive man made CO2.  	20	2

2019-08-19 03:44:02	Nikki Arthur	So, if all the ice melts, why wouldn't that cover the earth in a global flood like in Noah's day?      The melting ice would not be enough to cover the whole earth as before because, in Noah's day , the Bible says all the fountains of the Earth were opened up ( including both geysers and volcanos) and all the windows of the heavens were opened up ( openings for watery deposits by passing comets).      This means that, in addition to melted ice, all the water under the Earth, and all the water in the heavens were emptied on the surface all at once, resulting in rising levels and cascading tsunamis, enough to cover the highest mountains.      The lava from erupting volcanoes displaced water, also raising levels.      God promised never to flood the whole earth again like he had done in Noah's day. But, he did say the next destruction would be by fire. Make your paths straight.  	31	6

Sea levels have been rising since the last glacial maximum, a total of about 120 metres in 20,000 years, and that is published and peer-reviewed research based on evidence and not computer models..  	31	2

2019-12-08 15:31:12	F.B.I	@(*after receiving more information since my last comment) You mean the constant naturally disasters. The earth has already had 4 climate changes, the upcoming one being the fifth (correct me if I'm wrong). Since it's a natural occurrence you cannot stop it, but you can prevent some of its destruction. The only way to truly stop climate change is to create technology that affects things on a planetary scale operating 24/7, which I doubt we will do in the next 10,000 years. The thing that releases the most CO2 into the atmosphere is water vapor, humans make of less than 2%, so if climate change is coming as fast as scientist say it is, we either have to accept the inevitable or pray to the water gods and tell them to stop water from evaporating.  	31	2

2019-07-25 23:14:48	tyler0896	More people should be shown it wouldn't be the "end of the world". The biggest hits would be to our pride in our oh-so-beautiful coastal cities. I doubt many of them know that sea levels were 130 feet higher only 18 thousand years ago. You know what people used to do when sea levels rose? Grab their sticks and animal skins that were all their "coastal cities" were made of, and saunter a few miles inland. Of course we can't exactly do that with 1000 foot tall buildings, can we? Boo-hoo.  	31	3

All of the Trillions of tons of water would be pushing in on the crust. The Gravity of it all. It could be even dangerous to the world . The earth is not really round it's thicker at the Equator and a little flatter at the North and south pole. Why ? because the would is going around.and at the Equator it is being pushed out somewhat.The earth is like a Orange, if you put pressure on it and put a little hole in it ,it would act like a volcano with the juice coming out. with all this water It's not going to be the same.. Not only that , the earth turning will slow down more somewhat as the ocean has been doing for billions of years  	31	6

2019-07-18 04:34:34	Paul Sinclair	​@ Point #1: If you read my comment I mentioned "the local news". I said nothing about FoxNews. Point #2: I go to the beach regularly. I think I would know sooner than some liberal egghead in New York if/when the ocean was flooding my local beaches. Twenty years ago I was told a good portion of Florida would be underwater by now, but the beaches still look the same, and no houses are underwater. Believe what you want to believe, but oceanfront property is still very expensive down here, so apparently I'm not the only person that rolls his eyes every time a "scientist" tells me global ing will chase us all towards the middle of the country to prevent drowning. Point #3: I don't need Google; I have eyes, and common sense.  	31	2

2019-08-22 10:10:43	Petr Kašpárek	 yeah you’re right im in the center of europe and we have practically no huricanes but you were talking about flods caused by melting ice or snow in switzerland. Why I think that it´s incorrect is because in Austria for exaple you have alps which are very high aswell (almost 4000m or 13k feet) which constitute 62% of the nation's total area. During winter they sometimes even have to call an army so that the villages and cities can stay in contact, or else they would stay cut off because of the amount of the snow. This happens every year and the snow obviously melts as the temperature rises during the spring. Yet there are no flods or other natural disasters caused by melting ice. That is why i think that the your original comment is just a nonsence  	31	6
2019-08-21 23:57:24	BenjaminFranklin99	@ Totally wrong. Every high tide and storm brings more disasters. Miami is already flooding. If you are in Europe, you have no clue what a hurricane is like. Wind pressure increases by the square of wind speed.  	36	3

Climate is changing every day / hour.  had animals and forests before it's modern ice, Earth had several ice ages followed by global ing - so where is the danger? Man will adapt & survive, animals will adept and survive. The only&permanent danger is human greed, his hunger for money and more money without restriction and responsability. And I'm not talking about those people who live day by day with great restrictions from a financial crisis to another, but about those who put their wealth before everything.

2019-11-17 16:06:14	ModernMyths	i dont think you understand how stone is formed my friend, or how magma works, the entire mass of the earth is a constant, for the most part, there are cases where more mass is added, but minimal, stone is converted back into magma as tectonic plates push one another back beneath each other, it isnt a case of one producing another, but rather each being the same thing in a different state of matter, and it will be an extremely long time before the inner layers of the earth would be able to cool enough to make an impact, infact, its likely that the earth will be consumed by the sun long before that would ever come to pass  	31	2
2019-07-01 23:32:07	Scott McCollum	This is obviously another animation that takes the volume of all world ice and adds it to the current sea level, but the problem is that only ice melt on land would contribute to ocean levels. Northern polar ice and ice ts net zero rise when melted.  	5	6
2019-07-06 00:11:55	Ayndy Rand	Thank you for the rational input-good point. As I recall, water ice has a larger volume than liquid water- so water and ice mixture has less volume when the ice melts........ OMG the sea level is getting lower.  	33	6

2019-06-30 03:14:47	devin carson	@ ice in the water already, shrinks in volume when it melts, back to the volume it was displacing so nothing changes.Most of the arctic ice melts every spring and refreezes every winter as opposed to Antarctica where most of the ice is on land in the form of glaciers which move very slowly and do not melt like glaciers farther from the poles. The arctic ice changes nothing and it will always be too cold at the south pole for the land ice to melt no matter what the average temperature is for the entire earth. Same with alpine glaciers above a certain elevation which are replenished every winter, though all glaciers have been shrinking since the end of the last ice age. In order for the oceans to rise 1 ft. you would need approx. 3 ft of water/ice covering every sq. ft. of land on earth due to the 71%/29% ratio of ocean to land. Seems like there are a lot of "scientists" out there that are unable to grasp these basic facts.  	31	6

Then the event that we are opposing that is more certain to happen than "climate change/global ing, cooling" due to this event being Global governance/agenda21 and agenda 2030. Talk about some scary shit people. These globalists are so close to implementing this they don't even try to hide it anymore. So tit for tat. Show those stick people being wiped off the planet when the globalists tsunami is a done deal. Every single person will suffer as  has ever imagined. Kiss every freedom and right goodbye and if you try to dissent you are ELIMINATED. What would you rather keep your freedom or some real estate along the coastlines?

The only thing carbon reduction will do is slow it down, it won't stop it. If you want to invest in it, buy land at the 100 foot contour. You'll have ocean front property in 1,000 years!  	31	2

2019-06-22 03:57:24	Cats rule	it is so cold in antartica it doesn't even snow, if the earth ed, then antartica would snow. most of the northern hemisphere excluding greenland is already in the water, it is called displacement, and if it melted you would see no net change if only greenland melted it would only go up a little, think of it, the ocean is over 70% of the earth green land has very little ice. the hoaxter "scientists" claim if the earth gets this hot, the methane from oceans would disperse and would increase the speed of th ,the atmosphere would go away, and the entire oceans would vanish like mars, this is most likely not going to happen for billions of years and only because the sun loses power and the effects the sun has on dying(entropy). so these claims are chicken little bs and not substantiated by verifiable facts. these are only projections that can't be proven false until the dumb dumb "scientist" or bill nye who claimed it ,has already been dead for hundreds of years.  	31	6

2019-06-20 03:53:45	himorry1	My comment got cut off midstream. It took a chunk of time. I will assume it will appear somewhere, incomplete, after review. I'll complete it here with a quick summary of the first "part" of it.      Summary of point 1   Just as nothing happens to the water level in your glass when the ice cubes floating partially above the surface melt back into it, so will floating is in the seas and at the poles have essentially zero effect on sea level. Sea level has been rising slowly for MILLIONS OF YEARS.   It's due mostly to erosion of land which gets disolved into the seas and of which some comes to rest at the sea floor kinda permanently. This lifts the water a tiny bit cuz its resting on a higher floor, and it takes land from the shore. There is also some DEPOSITING of solid mass onto the shores too. Both factors are almost infinitesimal but the DIFFERENCE BETWEEN their opposite effects is REALLY infinitesimal. Net, the life expectency of our species is probably a WHOLE lot less than the time it's gonna take for anything remotely like that video depicts. It's not gonna happen from "global ing," and especially not from anything mankind puts into the atmosphere.      2\. Earth's water is a fixed supply, that flows AROUND in a closed circuit, VERY MUCH LIKE THE BLOOD IN YOUR BODY. Warmth during the daytime every day causes water to evaporate from the sea surface into the atmosphere. When it cools (over land or at night) it condenses and rain falls out of the atmosphere down to the land and sea surfaces below the atmosphere. The water falling on land travels back to the sea via rivers and streams, both underground and at the surface. It's a fixed "pot" of water that cycles around and around repeatedly. When the earth's temperature s or cools, the evaporation of water from sea to atmosphere increases or decreases. In a world of er atmosphere, THERE WILL BE MORE, NOT LESS, SEA WATER EVAPORATED INTO THE ATMOSPHERE. MORE OF THE EARTH'S AREA WILL ACQUIRE JUNGLE-LIKE, HIGH HUMIDITY AIR, INCLUSING GREATER RAINFALL. This means more water will, at all times, be in the "pipelines" of circulating back toward the sea, and LESS water actuall in the sea. MUCH more of earth's water will reside in the atmosphere at all times, and in the water that's on land. ENROUTE back to the sea from a place OUTSIDE the seas.      Not only for the reason just given, but because the equatorial type climate over more of the earth's area will mean MORE DENSE PLANT LIFE, which in turn would mean more animal life. IE, more "biomass" \-- and vitually all living things are made of a LOT of WATER. Just look at our planet now: Look at the equator and the poles. Where do you see more greenery, more bio-diversity, and more living matter? IN THE WARM AREAS CLOSEST TO THE HOT EQUATOR CLIMATE. Where do you see a relative paucity of life and biomass? At the desolate cold areas near the poles. Contrary to the conclusions drawn by the warped and false "science" of the authors of the above video, ing of the planet will put the oceans' water into more use as LIVING ENTITIES, BOTH ANIMAL AND PLANTS, and that permanently increased mass of living things, that wonderful BIODIVERSITY these same people beg for while calling for policies that would diminish it, the more it would create the effect of LOWERING sea level, by extracting more water from the seas.         3\. As time goes by and those whe were already adults in the 70s die off, so do memories of that past. Fewer and fewer remember that the VERY SAME PEOPLE SCREAMING AGAINST WARMING AND BLAMING IT ON CO2, ARE THE ONES who screamed wild warnings, in the early '70s, of an imminent ice age, of such MASSIVE global COOLING that all plant life, including food plants, would be so reduced, even in the USA -- richest nation on earth with a super breadbasket of the central part of our nation -- would result in starvation to such an extreme t hat our population will fall to a mere 10% of its then 160 million in 35-40 years -- ie, by the year 2000. Instead of dropping by 90% through starvation, we've INCREASED populatoin by over 100% -- more than a double to over 320million today. And, we're a far more obese population. "living on the fat of hte land" instread of having 90% starve to death or die from malnutrion's effects on our immune   systems.who      The people behind THAT scam were THE SAME ONES THAT SWITCHED TO GLOBAL WARMING in the early '80s.      That's right. Of course new people have been born during the past 40 yrs, but people like  Ehrlich and Dr n Schneider who were the "big guns" of the global cooling scam, just quieted down when the data started coming in showing a little ing, instead of drastic cooling. Dr Schneider is supposedly the father of using computer models to project climate changes. He was (may still be, I think) a professor at Stanford Univ in CA, and he helped gather a group of renowned scientific charlatans called "The Club of Rome" to push their crappy and worse than worthless projections and forecasts, and to scare the population to pieces.      Among others, there's a 30 year cycle of atmospheric temperature. It had been in a downswing for around 25 years in 1970 when the "global coolers" began their panic mongering. Within a half decade or less, the numbers started proving them wrong. So . . . they did not admit error but just kept quiet for a few years, then as the public forgot their earlier scam-production activities, Dr Schneider and his cohorts slowly began the popularization of global ing, caused by CO2 emissions, just as their cooling computer models had blamed CO2. The same liars, I mean people (allegedly) were behind the global ing hoax, and still are, as teh ones who'd created the global cooling hoax that precedied it. On difference is that the 30 year cycle now gave them 20-25 more years to count on for exhibiting some ing. So . . . tll had time to milk their scam into $fortrunes and fame for themselves.      Instead of the Club of Rome they had the  of Concerned Scentists to brainwash the n public. That group claimed to have 1,100 scientists agreeing with the threat of global ing. They would not name those people. Years later it was discovered that the vast majority of them were in "science" fields that include culinary science (ie, chefs). Meanwhile, 31,000 people with degrees in RELEVANT sciences (math, physics, chemistry, biology, etc) signed a petition to stop any significant attempts to aim gov't policy against global ing because they could prove very dangerous, since there was virtually zero scientific evidence for man caused global ing, and TREMENDOUS evidence refuting it. This however was not popularized by the media who favored the global ing scare tactics, which sell magazines and newspapers. And frankly, it's a know statistic that the field of journalism is populated by people of below average intelligence among the professions (studies show that students in journalism schools average being in the bottom 30% among those in other professional fields. Remember that when reading the news or watching it on TV).      Well, despite its length the above is the mere tip of the , appropriate enough in a comment about melting ice. I just hope this comment doesn't exceed the size limit -- I've been told nothing about that so if there is a limit, I'll be very upset that it has not been made explicit.               .  	31	2

No, seriously.  has an extremely large number of lakes, with the number of lakes larger than three square kilometres being estimated at close to 31,752 by the  of . Of these, 561 lakes have a surface area larger than 100 km2, including four of the Great Lakes. I am pretty sure that the chain of lakes from Northwest  through the Great Bear and Great Slave lakes and down towards the western tip of Lake Superior would be underwater. I am also fairly certain that Hudson's Bay would swell, overflow her borders and flood her drainage basin; which is almost the entire 10,000,000 km2 of 's surface area. 's transformation would be devastating, leaving mainly the  Mountain, Appalachian and Laurentian chains above water. I think that adding  to the video would add a tremendous amount of insight as to how the rising of the world's sea levels affect large land-masses.  	31	3

Especially since much, if not most, is a product of computer models, equations and crumbs of questionable data from questionable so called scientists on government payrolls, instead of hundreds and thousands of years of real data. Remember, state of the art science for it’s time also claimed the Earth was flat and that man would never fly. And we all know how those turned out. In just a few years, the science of today will also be thought of as primitive and the cycle repeats itself all over again. Unproven science is only a theory, and so far, that’s all they have and flimsy ones at that. And even more so since in this case, it’s junk science with the end goal of global control. At the end of the day, there is absolutely NOTHING anyone can do or say to change that.  	35	2

They kept the Electric Car(s) from ever getting onto the market & had them recalled by GM & Toyota back in 2005  This is what the Earth will look like in about 25 or 30 years. You can thank every single politicians that took a bribe from Big Oil, every Big Oil Executive, every Wall Street Operative that helped Big Oil for this. They have doomed all of Mankind. They have perpetuated their lies for years & have their "Brain Dead Propaganda Zombies" vomiting forth their Mouth Poop about Global Warming denial. Just remember this, if the world goes, then so does the Political Military Industrial lex along with it. By 2100  the Earth will be very uninhabitable for the Human Race. So to the RNC especially & DNC  Dog Democrats or Corporate Democrats I want to thank you for dooming the Human Race because of your greed.

I have studied this subject in great length since 1974  I prefer to live in the world of science. I may no longer have 20/10 vision, but clearly the Seasons are off. The winters are shorter, 1 or 2 days of snow. The summers are hotter on record than ever before. You have your opinion, and I have mine. We will not agree, therefore, we can agree to disagree. I am not beholden to the Big Oil anies like even 1/2 of their well paid pleasure devices, therefore I can afford to tell the truth. Till our next discussion. Best regards.  	20	2

2019-06-03 23:00:37	Chris White	@ yes. it's not simple by any means. the extreme introduction of fresh water to the ocean system will shut down the currents as we know. the north will be cooler and most likely drier than normal which will hypothetically lower the great lakes water level and possibly start a new ice age. so there's that.  	5	6
2019-06-03 22:31:56	Stefan Griffiths	Yeah, all ice melting. I'm not sure your considering how much more water into the atmosphere that is...  	33	6
2019-06-03 22:24:21	Chris White	@ sorry no that's not how the Great Lakes work it would have to rain an extreme amount to even make a foot of difference. And we're talking like Monsoon quality rain amounts  	5	3
2019-06-03 22:08:03	Stefan Griffiths	More melted ice means more water, which is then absorbed into cloud formation and falls as rain in low lying areas, so it doesn't just affect coastal regions  	5	6

2019-10-01 06:17:36	Richard Schofield	@ You are miss understanding something. Knowing that you don't know a lot of things is not ignorance. The more you learn, the more you realise that every subject has its complexities. So the more you realise there is a lot you don't know. With knowledge you become more humble. How did I dissapoint exactly?  	33	5
2019-10-01 00:22:09	Mr Sun Yat Sen	 There is a fine line between stupidity and and actual questioning but saying that there is plenty we don’t know is ignorance in itself for we can calculate what the displacement of water will do we know how the area looks with modern technology some people don’t revive failure kindly and keep on fighting but tre only fighting a battle that will embarrass them self’s I knew that the displacement wouldn’t really effect how much land there was but information changes so I decided to to a search and I felt that these people might be in to something that I might learn something new but as most people do they dissapoint like you  	35	3
2019-09-30 20:04:23	Richard Schofield	@ I'm guessing you did a little research and then felt a bit daft. Don't feel daft for your ignorance. There's plenty we all don't know. But you should feel daft for how you so quickly jumped down people's throat when you had no knowledge on a subject. Not cool, learn a lesson from this.  	37	5
2019-09-10 01:36:36	al cohalic	@ 1stdefeinc is correct. I researched it. you owe a apology.  	37	5
2019-09-02 13:19:34	Devin Michael Roberts	@ he's somewhat right, but not by much.. the 27 million billion tons of weight would maybe have a small effect on the continents elevation, but nothing insanely drastic. You are talking maybe a few meters of elevation difference. The fact is most of antartica is high elevation, the highest land mass on earth in fact. so 200 feet of sea level rise wouldn't do shit, it would still be a massive continent that now would potentially be the best place for humans to live in a ing world.  	5	6

2019-07-19 19:09:29	1stdefenseinc	@ The weight of the ice will be gone. Duh. Look up why the great lakes are getting smaller and how Norway has risen since the ice age. Or just be stupid.  	5	6

2019-10-19 16:10:52	Roger Blackwood	@ A well researched and logical answer yet  give you a thumbs up? I have done very similar research and come to the same conclusion as yourself, but one thing I can't find is any records where the Poles are above freezing level long enough to melt completely. So as with all theories, tre great but the reality maybe somewhat different. Meaning the theoretical maximum of 250' sea level rise is "Probably" not achievable? The thing I like to consider is at the end of the day the sun will die and the earth, if it still exists will just turn into an ice ball wandering through  until it hits something or gets pulled in by another galaxy. We humans have a big problem as we only live for an extremely short period of time, and as such we are unable to look at the big picture, overall trends are very different to the tiny peaks and troughs along the way. If you take any 100 year period and look at house prices in the UK, you will see an upward trend of a good magnitude. But you can selectively pick shorter periods of say 10 years where you could see a drop in prices. The g I find most interesting is the world population g, it follows the temp gs quite closely, funny that? I honestly can't understand how anyone cannot see that 7.5 billion people must use 7.5 times as much energy and resources as 1 billion? and the consumption of all resources to sustain this life must increase by the same, if not larger amount? Therefore the carbon dioxide levels don't match the population figures and they should rise equally? The big question is why not one of the organisations that seem to get over represented in the media never mention this? Most even advocate more and more immigrants to join our party? I think you will find it is all about the money, GROWTH etc, not saving the planet. They couldn't care less what happens after they leave this earth!  	31	2

2019-08-28 19:19:05	Jeremy Ze tree	@  there are probably a lot of ways we can stop coasts from being ruined, but I believe the best choice is to move inward.  	1	3
2019-08-28 13:38:49	Michael Basurto	@ true most ing and cooling of the earth has been more of a mixed bag for life then a total disaster. However since most people live at or near coastal cities our civilization isnt exactly equipped to handle that. In addition we haven't really had a lot of examples of quick climate changes. Most climate shifts have taken hundreds of thousands of years we are on pace to do it in thousands (if not less). So global ing may not be the end of the world but it's still a pretty serious issue.  	31	2
2019-08-07 22:54:22	Jeremy Ze tree	@ I mean the world is getting hotter anyways, we are just making it get hotter faster. We can't really stop the world from getting hotter naturally. Besides, wewill just have to move new city construction farther from the coast  	20	2
2019-08-07 07:13:56	dominic stewart-guido	@ Thing is, many global cities will be flooded, and so mich infrastructure will be destroyed. While we will most likely be able to survive, it will be a severe handicap. The human race struggled in the ice age when there were glaciers not far from the tropics, and we will struggle on a planet that has rainforests close to the poles. We were designed very specifucally for a global environment not too different from the one we have now. Allowing this to happen will harm us way more than trying to prevent it now will, so why let it happen?  	31	2
2019-08-06 03:55:35	Jeremy Ze tree	@ I highly doubt the earth getting hotter from global ing would kill ALL life. Hotter from a meteor impact? Sure. The big different between humans and so much other life is our insane intelligence and adaptability. We never were that strong, but we were smart. Will lots of other species die out from the heat? Yeah most likely. However, we humans don't even have fur, we sweat and all that, designed to cool down easily. Humans can survive with so many handicaps. Your arms and legs are broken? NO PROBLEM! What if any other animal had their limbs broken? They would most likely die.  	3	2
2019-08-06 02:36:27	dominic stewart-guido	@ Yes, life was more productive when the poles where covered in tropical rainforests, but everytime something like this happened most life that was alive before the ing event went extinct, and if a similar ing were to happen the same thing would likely happen to us. So while the globe ing will mean more productivity and life will thrive more, most things that was alive before hand, including us would die. Also, a lot of people don't realize how the speed of global ing impacts life's ability to recover. If it happens extrememly quickly, as it is now, it is much more difficult for life to come back after dying.  	3	2

2019-06-21 01:55:11	Jeremy Ze tree	@ I have no idea what you are talking about. Anyways here is why global ing is not that bad. We are living in a glaciation, the step past ice age. Also, CO2 has been higher in previous eras than now. Also, there have been times when all ice has melted   Showing how CO2 has been higher millions of years ago  and-why-it-matters  How was life in those eras? Well, there was life, and they survived.   of-Evolution-MS-LS/  An ice age could be quite bad for us. The previous sources said life struggled to live in these cold ages, whereas er periods have actually had lots of thriving life, and imagine mile high glaciers. The only benefit really was the ability to walk to other continents.  explainer/7185002 Also, if all ice in the world melts, that would only take possibly 15% to 20% of earth’s surface. (I could not find a good source on this, however all sources talk about around 200 to 250 feet increase of sea level, but what does that MEAN?!?! If you can find a source that talks about this and gives a percentage that would be cool, but remember postglacial rebound and how when ice melts the earth decompresses)  what-percentage-of-the-earths-surface-would-be-water  rise-2/recovering-from-an-ice-age/  	31	2

2019-05-14 11:14:37	MrBasinator	Bullshit. Ice has more volume than water, so if it melts into water, the volume actually decreases. Antarctica has land underneath the ice, so if it'd all melt, that would absorb the "catastrophic" amount of water of the sea level rising which you guys try to push here. Also: climate changes so often. In the 1800s there was a cold period. In the 1500s a  period. Just fear mongering to trick us into obeying agenda 21+30. Nice try. Good bye.  	5	6

Antarctica will be freed from the grip of an ice age that started hundreds of thousands of years ago. In my opinion, according to this video, Asia appears to be the most devastated continent. population and economically. But again this video completely ignores most of the northern hemisphere so how accurate is it really.  	5	6

The person seeing the ice bulging out of the cup would not necessarily know how much water was in the cup to begin with and might think that when the ice melts that it would overflow from the cup but you know that it wouldn't. I believe this is a smaller scale example of this same idea with similar results. So you may be overestimating. I'm just saying.  	33	6

It's called DISPLACEMENT. ... for example, , fill a glass with water and add ice.. the water will overflow. .   HOWEVER, put the ICE in the glass of water and wait for the ICE to Melt....it will not overflow. . You may have condensation on the glass from the temperature change, with it will NOT flooded. ..the video don't account for evaporation ,,   There are VOLCANOES that are erupting and expanding,, it's like dropping a rock into the glass with ice.. now you have flooding! !!  	5	6

I don't think so because we still have a lot of "climate change" deniers who don't see the light, future and can't admit that science might be right that this can't be reversed anymore.

2019-04-30 15:23:24	Jeff Borders	But it won't melt. Earth is currently exiting an interglacial period. Earth is usually in full blown Ice Age mode. Periodically it thaws out for a little while. Like the last 12,000 years. this headline is simply more liberal fear porn propaganda scaring you into believing it's all your fault and if you don't pay more taxes then New York City loses some prime real estate you'll never be able to afford anyways. It couldn't be further from the truth. I invite you to check the charts for yourself and do the math yourself and you'll quickly realize the liberal propaganda machine is only trying to enslave you with fake news. Wake up! 1360 watts per meter squared. That's a whole lotta sunlight hitting the ground. A 0.1% reduction is enough to plunge Earth into another ice age. Everyone watch out.

I mean, sure CO2 is causing some of it and humans produce a lot of that. But one large impact from an asteroid or supervolcanic eruption will put our drop in the bucket into perspective. We suck as a species but the Earth and astronomical forces surpass anything any life can generate. We are literally just sitting ducks waiting for a cataclysm and our burning fossil fuels has a marginal impact on the climate in the grand scheme of things. That doesn't mean we shouldn't be more responsible.  	20	2

Bye Communism   Natural waterway is created between Pacific and Altantic Oceans in Central , reducing dependency on Panama Canal.   Florida goes for good. Al Gore would have won the election.   Libya drowns for good.   Persian Gulf becomes wider.   Hudson Bay becomes wider.   West Bengal and Bangladesh drown, reducing almost 300 million people from global population.

2019-04-29 19:53:15	Jack Sprat	The combined AREA of all the worlds oceans would be equivalent to the area of a square that would be about 11,800 miles on each side.      The combined VOLUME of all the current ice on land would be a rectangular cube about 11,800 miles on each side and 32.5 feet thick.      Hence, if all the icecaps in the world melted, sea levels would rise less than 32.5 feet. (<10 meter) (*)      (*)   Ice shrinks about 9% when it melts.   The area of the oceans would expand some as the water spreads out over new land areas.   If an  floating in the ocean melts it will not change the ocean level.  	5	6
2019-04-30 14:42:51	Jack Sprat	 The artic ice is not considered an icecap. There is the  icecap and the Antarctic icecap.  	5	6
2019-04-30 13:14:21	John Terpack	Less than that even. The northern ice cap is floating. So if it melted it wouldn't effect the level at all.  	5	6

2019-04-29 19:19:59	Fred Rahm	This is science???? The only ice that could appreciably raise sea levels is in Antartica (some from  as well). The amount of energy required to melt that much ice in anything other than multi-millennial time scales just doesn't exist. And no, not even even hyperbolic, exaggerated claims of 10 degrees Celcius would be enough. You might as well ask "What if the Earth was made of cheese, like the ?" ... it would make just as much sense.  	5	6

2019-04-29 19:14:31	Jack Sprat	ROULETTE MATRIX Right. Only ice on land would raise sea levels if it melted. If a floating  melts it will not raise the sea level. Reputable scientists that have done the calculations are saying sea levels would rise about 1 meter if all ice melted. 98% of the ice that was here during the height of the last ice advance (18,000 years ago) has already melted.  	5	6

You prefer your programming - that's fine - enjoy your programming. As a well-programmed imbecile who regurgitates the lies and lunacy you've been indoctrinated to believe, you think politicians are here to help - right? The world economy isn't controlled by the 1% - right? The justice system convicts those that have siphoned hundreds of trillions of dollars into their control - right? The stock market isn't manipulated - right? Schoolbooks and college textbooks aren't printed by publishing houses that are owned by the super rich - right? They wouldn't lie to us! Science is sacred - right? When do you plan to grow up? When will you find the courage to admit you're clinging to the inside walls of your prison of lies? You believe in the history, chemistry, geology and glaciology that you were programmed to believe? It's a pack of lies. You're a coward - and little else.  	31	2

If you think the political system and economic system are not contrived, corrupt and manipulated, if you think the fake justice system - that does nothing as hundreds of trillions of dollars are siphoned into the control of the 1% - is not corrupt, if you think the fake healthcare system / medical mafia is not also exploiting the public, if you think the military forces work for the people - when tctually work for the billionaires that control our world, if you think the public is taught the true history, the true chemistry, the true geology, the true glaciology, etc., then do yourself a huge favor and find the courage to face the conspicuous facts.

2019-05-02 17:31:25	Soulful Truth	All it takes is one more underwater Antarctic volcano to explode and that'll rip open the ice shelf that's above it which means that ice shelf won't be able to hold the glaciers above it in place which means those glaciers - the size of Pennsylvania, etc., and two miles deep - will plop into the sea which will displace massive volumes of sea water which will launch colossal tsunami waves which will dislodge the other ice shelves which will result in thousands of colossal Antarctic glaciers plopping into the sea which will displace even more sea water which will launch thousands of more colossal tsunami waves that will trigger a ricocheted domino effect of worldwide decimation - we know this because historic records clearly explain this exact scenario which then results in the explosion of thousands of volcanoes which bury thousands of cities beneath thousands of feet of sedimentary layers of volcanic ash - the previous decimation began in Antarctica, destroyed it all, then destroyed what we know as  and the  Pacific, western regions of Latin  and almost all of , the Arctic, northern Europe and Siberia, , Iceland, completely obliterated Frisland, etc. - it's all documented in historic records by numerous independent sources, including the exact date in different languages by people more than 16,000 km apart. - so we know what to expect but since the public is lied to about the history of our Earth, since the public is lied to about the timeline for the cataclysms that destroyed entire continents, since the public is lied to about the forces that formed the Pacific Ring of Fire, since the public is lied to about when and how the tectonic plates were broken and subducted, since the public is lied to about when and how our ocean trenches were caves out, when and how our archipelago islands were formed, when and how our continents, mountains and oceans were formed, etc., the public remains ignorant, confused and easily to manipulate with the CO2 nonsense, the 2C lunacy, the CH4 scare, the SLR in 2100 stupidity, the climate collapse idiocy and so on. The Antarctic ice has been in rapid meltdown over the past several years because of the volcanoes that have been rising up and erupting beneath the ice shelves - you don't see this on the news that's controlled by the billionaires that controls what the public thinks and believes - but the reports of the escalating horror in the Antarctic are uploaded online for anyone who's tuned in enough to monitor what's going on. Those who want to survive have already packed, relocated, stocked up and prepared for worldwide decimation - we have little hope for the other 99.999% - which includes the billionaires that think their money will save them - their private jets can't save them because the volcanic ash will clog their engines - their private yachts can't save them because the tsunami waves will be so huge, all the watercraft will be destroyed - including aircraft carriers, submarines, etc. - their underground survival facilities won't save them either because the tectonic plates all across the world will be reconfigured as thousands of volcanoes explode while colossal tsunami waves decimate our lands - so DE is right, we don't need all of the Arctic or Antarctic ice to melt to have devastating results, all it takes is one more Antarctic volcano to explode and we don't know when that will happen - why doesn't the  tell this to the public? Because "scientists" tend to have little interest in historic records.  	31	2

2019-04-29 08:58:40	John Hand	So where did that famous “consensus” claim that “98% of all scientists believe in global ing” come from? It originated from an endlessly reported 2009 n Geophysical  (AGU) survey consisting of an intentionally brief two-minute, two question online survey sent to 10,257 earth scientists by two researchers at the University of Illinois. Of the about 3.000 who responded, 82% answered “yes” to the second question, which like the first, most people I know would also have agreed with.      Then of those, only a small subset, just 77 who had been successful in getting more than half of their papers recently accepted by peer-reviewed climate science journals, were considered in their survey statistic. That “98% all scientists” referred to a laughably puny number of 75 of those 77 who answered “yes”.      That anything-but-scientific survey asked two questions. The first: “When compared with pre-1800s levels, do you think that mean global temperatures have generally risen, fallen, or remained relatively constant?” Few would be expected to dispute this…the planet began thawing out of the “Little Ice Age” in the middle 19th century, predating the Industrial Revolution. (That was the coldest period since the last real Ice Age ended roughly 10,000 years ago.)      The second question asked: “Do you think human activity is a significant contributing factor in changing mean global temperatures?” So what constitutes “significant”? Does “changing” include both cooling and ing… and for both “better” and “worse”? And which contributions…does this include land use changes, such as agriculture and deforestation?  	20	2

2019-04-27 14:02:54	111Vengeance	Hey everyone. Don't let the ridiculous dramatic music scare you. This will never happen. Average temperature in Antarctica is -37 so unless it heats up enough to boil are brains out then little ice in Antarctica will melt. So basically, this will never happen. Sea levels could potentially rise 5% of this doomsday scenario in the worst case  	5	6
2019-04-27 12:49:45	Retro Lab	The ice melting wont change the rising of water. If the snow on one of the poles melt. It will change the tides by alot. Put a ice cube in a glass of water, and let it melt. Once you put the ice in, it will rise, but not after it has melted. It has the exact same level of water in it.  	5	6

I also doubt this move uses any calculated or simulated values, i bet it is just "artistic interpretation" filling with blue all places up to some line above sea level, arbitrary line. And last thing that is kind of connected to "artistic license" ice floats on water, so parts of ice that are floating cannot be included into that "artistic license simulation", Archimedes would disagree if one added that ice volume. I am more worried about gulf-stream stopping and causing rapid change to climate than any rising sea levels. And one question why this movie does not show ``new lands in north becoming more hospitable, or openning of north pole route for ships? Are those not fitting narrative much?  	31	6

2019-04-20 09:30:24	Richard Guy	n case you don't know I am telling you what is happening in Chesapeake Bay for  is telling you the truth because they don't know the truth themselves. The entire Chesapeake Bay is being torn apart/widening by the expanding earth process. As it separates the land on both sides of the bay sinks as well as all the Islands in the Bay. Tangier and smith Islands as well as 13 other islands have been sinking for years, its well documented. So don't worry there is nothing you can do about it except move to higher ground. If you don't believe me check the Jersey Atlantic City shore line and you will see that the sea is receding allowing New Jersey to sell off the newly created shoreline to be sold off to Trump and Playboy at fantastic prices. See The New York Times article of 2007. "Jersey Rights to shore prove Costly to Casinos" Now you know the truth!  	31	3

2019-04-19 20:09:59	Jeffrey Gresswell	The ice caps are Earth's great safety valves, but  seems to be recognizing this. The latent heat of ice means it takes 240 times the energy (heat) to melt one gram of ice than to raise one gram of water by 1ºC. When all the ice has gone that safety valve will have gone and you won't have to worry about rising sea levels anymore because water will start to evaporate away from heat that otherwise would melt ice. The atmosphere will be like an overcharged battery with 100% humidity , fogs, clouds, storms and high winds whether tornadoes or hurricanes or not. Methane released into the atmosphere is 21 times stronger as a greenhouse gas but aint nothing compared to the effect on water when the ice is gone. We'd better act now or it WILL be too late.  	31	6

Studying the Dolores Cannon books Conversation with Nostradamus you will learn that first there is the Polar shift in 2029. Then the earth's tectonic plates begin a process of reconfiguration during which earth will only retain 10% of its current landmass. By 2089 there will only be 124 million people left on the planet. In the Nostradamus model  is the luckiest landmass and will retain most of its original landscape.  	31	2
2019-04-06 20:29:40	April Arnold	My name is ( Kenneth Arnold's flying saucer 1947) last daughter. Do not be afraid. There is a solar system coming through our solar system with planets that are showing up on cameras. This is normal for our planet. Planet Niburu and or planet X is apart of that solar system coming through but has not passed yet. It will come close to the earth and will be seen. This will take about 28 minutes, the whole earth will be shaking, pole shift will happen. If you are on the coasts and want to live through this event move now to middle of USA. If you believe in our creator "God" Which I believe, "Alien who looks like humans. I believe in Father God and Lord God. Jesus who was Lord God in the flesh who came to earth and was resurrected. We as the children of God are so special we are like iamonds in his hands and are tested each day to become part of his      Government which will be on the earth and where He will live and rule the the entire creations all solar systems of the heavens, dimensions and time. God comes back to save the earth. Not because of this event but soon and only the father in Heaven knows the time. Peace and Love to you all for we are all family. Our lives are very short and we all will be resurrected and meet again. If you read this and know that this is the truth repent and be baptized.

2019-04-04 20:32:22	hizirov yusup	The seasonal increase in water level of the seas and oceans.      The waters of the lakes, seas and oceans of the northern hemisphere rotate counterclockwise, and the waters of the southern hemisphere rotate clockwise, forming cyclonic gyres.   The main cause of rotation of the whirlpools are local winds, flowing into the seas and oceans of the river and the deflecting force of Coriolis.         And the higher the speed of the winds, the higher the speed of rotation of the whirlpools, and as a result, the higher the centrifugal force of the whirlpools, thereby increasing the water level of the seas and oceans.   And the lower the speed of rotation of the whirlpools, the lower the level of water, seas and oceans.      The speed of currents along the perimeter of the seas and oceans is not the same everywhere and depends on the depth of the coast.   In the shallow part of the seas and oceans, the flow moves fast, and in the deep water part of the seas and oceans the flow moves slowly ..      Seasonal rise in the water level is observed not along the entire coast of the seas and oceans, but only on those coasts where the high angular velocity of the currents and, as a result, the high centrifugal force of the water. (Centrifugal force F = mv2 / r).   On straight coasts, where currents do not have an angular velocity, the water level does not rise.   Real-time sea current speed             The waters of the Gulf of Finland rotate counterclockwise, forming a whirlpool in the form of an ellipse.   And when the seasonal south-westerly winds unwind the whirlpool to 5 km / h, the centrifugal force of the whirlpool rises, so that on the east coast of the Gulf of Finland the water level rises to 30 cm.   A similar pattern of seasonal increase in water levels is observed in all lakes, seas and oceans ..      The average depth of the Gulf of Finland is about 50 meters, on the east coast is about 5 meters, in the west of the bay it is about 100 meters, for this reason the linear and angular velocity of currents on the east coast of the Gulf of Finland is much higher (as much as the depth of the coast increases current velocity) ..      In the Gulf of Finland, the seasonal increase in water levels has two peaks: in August-September and in -January and in time they coincide with the season of south-westerly winds.   The speed of the current in the Gulf of Finland reaches from 2 to 17 km / hour, and the maximum speed of the current on Earth reaches 30 km / hour, the wind speed is more than 100 km / hour.            The waters of the North Sea rotate counterclockwise, forming a huge whirlpool.   And when seasonal northwestern storm winds unleash a whirlpool (up to 20 km / h on the southern coast), the centrifugal force of the whirlpool rises, making the level on the southern coast of the North Sea up to 5 meters.   (Storm surge 2.5 meters, centrifugal surge 2.5 meters).            The waters of the Caspian Sea rotate counterclockwise, forming a whirlpool in the form of an ellipse.   And when the seasonal winds and the flood river Volga unleash a whirlpool, the centrifugal force of the whirlpool rises, making the water level up to 1 meter on the north coast of the Caspian Sea.      The average depth of the Caspian Sea is about 200 meters, on the north coast about 5 meters, on the south coast - about 500m.   Due to this, in the north of the Caspian Sea the speed of the current increases from 1 to 10 km / h.   In the Caspian Sea, the peak of the seasonal rise in water level is observed in June-August and coincides in time with the season of winds and high water of the Volga River.   During a drought over the Volga River basin, the level of the Caspian Sea does not rise.            In the Bay of Bengal, in the season of monsoon winds, the whirlpool speed rises to 10 km / h, making the seasonal rise in water levels up to 1.2 meters.         Seasonal increase in the level of the Black Sea (up to 40 cm) is most pronounced in the southeastern part of the sea, where in summer the angular velocity of the currents reaches its maximum value.         The assumption that the cause of the seasonal rise in the water level may be the pressure of the atmosphere, the flow of the rivers, the temperature difference and the salinity of the waters do not hold water, these factors may raise the water level by a few cm, but no more.            The presented theory can be easily verified by relating the velocity of the currents to the level of the seas and oceans.   (Based on a map of depths and currents, seas and oceans).

We were hit by a comet, so nearly all of the rest of the planet was devastated by tidal waves, earth quakes, and massive melt water from the n ice cap.      And then, we wonder why there isn't much left of the pre-civilizations. We can barely hold a city together in a hurricane as it is now. And a hurricane would have been pleasant weather compared to the Younger Dryas.       points-climate-altering-impact-time-humans  	31	2

2019-06-06 02:12:59	Carlos_A_M	@ yeah. But we are the ones adding co2 and other gasses to the atmosphere. Just look at the gs. Since the industrial revolution co2 has increased alot, the sun became a bit less luminous, so it isnt that, volcanoes dont release that much co2, but if you take into consideration airplanes, , ships, submarines, powerplants and other man made machines that release greenhouse gasses, then sorry, it is us. Simple as that. Or we can send you to venus on a moon gravity assisted rocket so you can see what co2 can cause!  	20	2
2019-06-04 11:25:58	John Peric	@_A_M 1. You're assuming that there are no other factors except CO2 driving our current climate change, that simply isn't true. There are numerous large factors that act on decadal cycles, like oceanic oscillation, solar irridance, etc. It was these same large factors that allowed the medieval  period to be almost as , if not er than today, It was these same factors that allowed the Roman climate optimum to be 1C er than today, it was these same factors that allowed the Minoan and Holocene climate optimums to be 1-4C er than today. 2. You can tell you know nothing about climate science when you think the only green house gas humans emit is CO2, another one that we emit, that is nearly as, if not more, influential is methane, which although has only increased 1.2 ppm since the industrial revolution, it is 84 times more potent than CO2, meaning it has had the equivalent of 100 ppm of CO2 increase. 3. According to the logarithmic model of CO2 forcing, which is supported by numerous lab experiments, and lambert's law. The most ing CO2 could've produced since the industrial revolution is 0.5 to 0.15C, half of that should've occurred between now and 1980. Currently, the world is 1 to 1.5C er than the little ice age, so what caused that additional 0.5 to 1.35C of ing? Hint, other green house gases, and natural factors. More so natural factors prior to 1950. Also, if you are curious what lambert's law states in a grossly simplified way, the more energy that enters a system, the more that exits the system. The makes it so 50% of CO2s ing potential takes place when CO2 levels reach 20 ppm, 10-5% is meat when it rise from 280 to 420 ppm.    correct.png    	31	2
2019-06-04 02:47:47	Carlos_A_M	@ actually they can. Just add co2 to the air like we are currently doing and vuala.  	11	2
2019-06-04 01:33:14	John Peric	@_A_M you realize humans can't control the climate like that right?  	36	2
2019-06-04 01:18:24	Carlos_A_M	Or just stop thw fricking global ing  	3	1
2019-05-10 04:46:30	TheAtom	Way I see it there are a few possibilities; we’ll probably have a mix of floating cities & underwater cities or those areas will be off limit disaster zones pushing coastal populations further inland.  	1	3
2019-03-23 02:14:20	John Peric	Or just move further inland...  	11	3
2019-03-13 22:50:34	Ava Yu	Not as scary as I thought. Cuz most of the landmass are still there post melt scenario. And if it happens over time slowly, hardly noticeable. But in a tsunami that would suck for coastal dwellers and properties!  	5	3

2019-02-17 10:16:33	Renaldo Awesomesauce	Because you didn't even know a huge portion land in the sahara as well under the sea level. You even questioned where I was getting my facts from. Had this been a known fact to you, you would have prefaced your nasty reply with less bravado. But instead you were the mistaken one. I linked you new information, and then you typically started acting smart as if you were teaching me something. Yet this was the first time you had ever seen it. Your pride speaks volumes. Most people I encounter don't know about this massive land. And your attempts to reflect your ignorance on the basis of the r volume is desperate. Had this been important to you, it would have been in your initial protest. Not confused as to where we get our information from. Honestly.  	35	2
2019-02-17 08:21:01	Renaldo Awesomesauce	What happens next. There are other places you can fill. And you need to remember that realistically the ice caps will not melt all at once, even in the most dramatic simulations. This is a short term effort to prevent early flooding. Once society as a whole sees the seas rising and we have to resort to filling up part of the sahara, people will use other means to prevent global ing. And why am I wrong to make a good suggestion on the basis of "hurr durr well you didn't solve the ENTIRE problem at once!" But there are a lot of good zones to fill. You don't even need to fill up mass locations. You can use smart irrigation tactics and create artificial rivers pretty quickly. It's not all doom and gloom. Engineering can save us from the worst problems. Have a little faith!  	31	6
2019-02-17 08:15:36	Renaldo Awesomesauce	Well no shit not every inch of it. Now you're nitpicking beyond what I said. Just admit you were wrong and move on. A huge amount of land is well below the sea level and could be filled with water to fend off a lot of the future rising tides.  	5	3
2019-02-17 08:00:53	Bob Trenwith	@ Yes, the Qattara depression, not the whole damn Sahara. That is 0.2% of the Sahara. Filling the Qattara depression would lower global sea level by about 3 mm, removing only one year of rise. What happens next?  	5	3

The ice will come again, it always has. We ought to be praying for more CO2. Lots of stuff grows in a "green house" with CO2 levels double atmospheric levels. However, NOTHING grows on ts of ice hundreds of feet thick; as was the case during our most recent period of glaciation.  	31	6

2019-03-23 22:09:42	John Peric	@ 1. Trump isn't all Republicans, he one person, not to mention he isn't even a republican, he is an independent. He just had to chose a party to run as president. 2. The oceans are rising at a rate of around 1 inch every 4.5 years, that's literally slower than the continents are moving. That would mean we would have more than twelve thousand years before sea levels got that high, assuming a constant rate if melting. However, that is unrealistic being that most models are saying by the end of the century we'll be emitting half as much CO2 as we are now, around 30% are saying we'll even have net negative emissions, to almost as much as 20 billion ton decrease in CO2 a year (despite our population being 9-10 billion by then) meaning we will have capped out at 550 ppm CO2 levels at which point we'd only start to decrease in CO2 levels ( 550 ppm CO2 levels would mean a 2-4°C rise in temperatures, meaning around a 8 meter rise in sea levels over the course of centuries upon centuries, last time this happened was 8000-5000 years agp). This would meaning in as little as 80 years, our CO2 levels *could* return back to normal. Moreover, by the time 2200 roles around, our population will be anywhere from 1-5 billion. Meaning our CO2 emissions would massively decrease inevitably, and would definitely have a net decrease in CO2 levels. Meaning 11800 years before sea levels could ever get this high, we could easily reduce, or completely reverse our impacts. If we were to become more dependent on forest for building supplies, a rapidly growing trend in urban areas, we could replant all our forest that is practical and possible, meaning an extra 1.5 trillion tons of CO2 could be removed out of the air over the course of 40 years. You also fail to account for natural variability (I.e ocean currents, plant growth, and sat activity). In the past 30 years, plant growth has surged by 30%, ocean currents in the north Atlantic are slowing down, meaning a massive cool down could take place in Europe, and possibly global temperatures, and solar activity levels are dropping, and could drop to even below muander minimum levels within the next 2200 (resulting in a 1+°C drop in temperature.  	31	2
2019-03-23 12:22:49	Paul Simmons	@ 1. Trump did say it last year. 2. How do you know what the water levels will be, psychically gifted or using the "ostrich, head in the sand denial method?" 3. Incredible that you already know what's in the report, besides, the fun part is is still going on with the SDNY and Trump's business dealings. The Trump syndicate is still under active investigation. The fact that Trump's lost a number of henchmen is nothing like the indictments that may hit his family at some point. And the State of New York's investigations for tax and other business dealings are beyond the reach of a presidential pardon. Trump's family have their fingers in a number of things we've heard about and likely some that we haven't yet. And that's not even mentioning Congressional investigations that have been curtailed for the last few years. Nope, it's a bit early to say it's all good and turn the channel. Let's see what lies ahead for the Trumpster in the next year before we call it.  	31	3

Magnesium is out of ballance with other minerals causing the algea to use more oxygen than it produces, thereby increasing carbon dioxide levels.

2019-02-14 22:23:01	glen gillham	@ You Remind me of a story d once told me. My dad is one of the original people who worked a the first electronics companies that started Silicon Valley. Actually they made radar tubes for the militay and  programs. Another less experience person was arguing with d about the science involved in building tubes. the other person went and got the book that was the authority on the subject. He started going through the pages when d stopped him and told him to go to the beginning of the book. My dad pointed out the name of the author. The person noticed it is ds name.The world is full of people who want to be recognized without haveing the intelligence , integrity and knowledge to be right. I really don't think you have what it takes.  	19	5
2019-02-14 15:13:02	glen gillham	@ I have studied the subject for some time and have used intelligence to evaluate it. It is complex and I have other priorities. Look at deep sea lines from faults and you will notice underwater mountains. Unless the Earth speeds up and slows down often then there is a seperate force acting on them. Weight from polar ice compresses the Earth that works to hold the crust together not tear it .The result would be less cracks in the Earth crust along the rotation direction  	5	6

2019-02-14 12:51:29	glen gillham	@ Actually it is both but the main part is caused by ice. The proof is in the fractures which goes north and south except where the poles are. If it was centrifugal force the fractures would focus on the equader where the force would be greatest  	33	6

2019-02-06 20:06:13	Ayava Kyavata	After 15 years of my own research, I now theorize that global climate change will in large part be mitigated by 1) the hole in the ozone layer, 2) the decreasing levels of cow flatulence contained in aerosol cans, and 3) the fact that it will be coastal cities which flood, cities which we mostly use for commerce and don't really care about. Reminder that flooding coastal cities will always make MORE coastal cities, therefore there is a logical infinite regress so that a problem never actually develops.  	31	2

2019-02-05 14:47:15	David Stretton	This is scientifically wrong. When water freezes it expands, and when ice melts it contracts. This can be simply shown in a lab or even a kitchen. What the main difference would be is temperature, as ice reflects ultra violet and infra red radiation from the Sun. Water absorbs it. So temperatures would rise, rainfall would increase, BUT it is not about sea levels rising simply because the ice caps melt.  	5	6
2019-02-15 15:01:42	David Stretton	@ Goodness, who's an angry bird? Try meditation.......or medication! 😉  	4	5
2019-02-15 11:48:16	David Stretton	@ Actually around 95% or more of all the ice on Earth is locked up in the Antarctic and  ice ts. Neither of these are land based. When ice melts it contracts in total volume by about 9%. So it seems logical that the total volume of water/ice on the Earths surface will actually decrease slightly if these ice ts melt. With regard to the high specific heat capacity of water, the "heat sink" effect of more water may actually cause land temperatures to fall, but this would possibly be countered by less reflected radiation. BTW, is this a 5 minute argument or the full half hour?  	5	6
2019-02-14 14:16:50	Bob Trenwith	@ There is little point mentioning what you see as a contributing factor (water's high specific heat) without actually indicating what you believe this contribution to sea level rise is.  	5	2
2019-02-14 14:08:19	David Stretton	@ Ha, at last an intelligent comment. Yes, I agree, but the actual effects are far more complex, not least the "heat sink" nature of water, as opposed to the reflective nature of ice. Just looking out for intelligent life, ice or not!!  	33	6
2019-02-14 12:31:01	Bob Trenwith	Most of the earth's ice sits on the land. What do you think happens to sea level when it melts and runs off into the ocean?  	5	6

2019-02-05 11:33:36	Ted Smith	Not a very good representation. For instance, Lake Eyre in  is already below sea level and it is usually dry. It has no outlet to the ocean so a rise in water level will change nothing. I'm sure many other areas are in a similar situation. Also did you allow for the fact that the Arctic ice is already floating on the ocean so will not change the sea levels at all if it all melts?  	5	6
2019-02-05 10:59:22	Steven Lau	If ice melts, the ice wall surrounding the flat earth will disappear and water will flow away from the earth.  	5	6
2019-02-18 12:10:54	Steven Lau	@ Have you measure the distances yourself? Also, about the stats, I quote them from a website. "The answer? Scale, Perspective, Horizon!" “Scale: Earth is huge but the sky is even bigger. Some of the sky we can't see”. “Perspective: The amount of sky we see depends on where we are and which way we are looking”. “Horizon: We see the horizon as flat, so the lines get bent with perspective!!! So it looks like a second pole, but in reality it's just a massive perspective warp due to scale of the actual sky”.  	35	2

2019-02-14 14:49:25	Matthew Cino	@ And obviously you must qualify as a leftist tard baby because you believe proficiency in grammar is indicative of intelligence. You and that moron AOC probably get along well. Most studies conclude the same thing, there is more ice , not less.  	33	2
2019-02-14 14:26:12	Matthew Cino	@ it's a mute issue because all studies conclude there is more ice, not less and climate change is naturally ongoing even without industrial contributing factors. How about those blizzards? Lol  	20	2

2019-02-05 15:53:18	John Rettig	 It's only showing flooding up to the the Sacramento and surrounding areas what I am saying is that entire California Big Valley has to be flooded all the way up to the Sierra Hills jackass  	1	3

2019-02-15 21:13:49	Damnit Bobby	@Meme God Technically wrong. The Great Lakes feed fresh water into the Atlantic Ocean via the St Lawrence River. If the Atlantic Ocean rises (enough) the St Lawrence locks could be compromised by flooding over or around the locks even hundreds of miles away and causing salt water to flow into the Great Lakes. Granted the ocean would have to at the very least rise 243 ft high to breach Lake Ontario.  	11	3

2019-02-14 12:59:14	David Johnson	@ what happens when that water flowing off the mountain gets to  climates, evaporates, turns into clouds and is later deposited as snow in a place like Antartica.

2019-02-12 00:33:49	Kleffkey Po	The earth temperature range changes, it can't possibly be near the same temperatures through it's life. Just because the coldest temperatures we had in the past 8000 years was in like 1870 doesn't mean the planet is ing up now. Sure it might actually be getting er in the past like 8000 years, but you have to think of it on a larger scale. A dogs lifespan is 8-15 years, a humans? 70-80. think about how old the earth is. For all we know we could be heading into a ice age in the near future, and the earth is just getting slightly er then it's gonna start dropping. You can't possibly act like global ing is going to destroy our planet, whether it has to do with humans or not, considering we don't have enough data on the subject.  	31	2

2019-02-03 00:46:31	Absaalookemensch	I went to a coastal place that I lived 50 years ago.   I saw the high and low tide marks on the pier piles. The high and low tide marks were nearly identical as they were 50 years ago.   Half a century and I couldn't tell the difference. Not 1/2" per year, not 1/2" per 10 years, NO noticeable change after half a century.   The polar ice fields are growing as the did in the 1920s, 100 years ago. Expect sea levels to drop a little in the next 100 years.  	31	6

2019-05-02 20:04:20	Nepsy adult	@ Depends on at what pace the ocean waters rise. The sea levels were almost 300 feet (100 meeters) lower during the last ice age and human kind has faird just fine with that almost football field level of increased sea level over the past 12,000 years. And what's currently still locked up in the earths ice caps will result in about another 250 feet of sea level rise. So unless what's left of the earths ice caps melts away faster than over the next few thousand years we should be fine.  	31	6
2019-05-02 19:53:57	Nepsy adult	@FST Build a new financial and tech hub city further in and up land, simple, it doesn't all have to go under with the small amounts of coastal land that does. Just look at Nigeria a much less wealthy developing African nation. Their original capital city with millions of inhabitants is sinking due to slowly sinking poor foundation land and slowly raising sea water. Yet they have no issue in building a new capital city further inland. Therefore im under no doubt the US will adapt to the slowly rising waters as well.  	1	3

2019-04-26 22:29:39	John Peric	@ Would you like to provide evidence that isn't based on correlation or speculation? All IPCdels are based on correlation, not causation. So when speaking scientifically it isn't valid. Furthermore, even if they were right, and CO2 almost controls the entirety of the climate, they only predict a 2-4C rise in temperatures from the temperature levels seen during the LIA (hint hint, that is almost nothing). For some perspective, the Holocene climate optimum was as much as 4-6C er than today (on a global scale, however even er in the polar regions). That means those temperatures roughly 6000 years ago would still be 1-3C er than what even the IPCC expects. Postive feed backs are falcicious, even when CO2 levels were 17 times higher than today in the past we never had runaway ing. We also had no exponential ing during the Holocene climate optimum when massive amounts of permafrost would've melted (for some perspective it was so  the  ice t shrunk by roughly 170,000 sq kilometers, or the size of the state of Missouri). Also, no we have teenagers advocating for fighting it because they've basically been brainwashed into thinking if the worlds temperatures rise 1-2C the world will end, and they think humans are the primary driver (we have no evidence for that whatsoever).  	31	2
2019-04-26 22:15:44	Nimo Kali	@ It's not debatable. The debate is over. Acting scientists were paid millions for over a decade to cover up the truth for oil companies.

Because ignorant s like you enjoy down playing this crisis.  	20	2
2019-04-26 20:21:34	John Peric	@ eh, this will never happen though is the main thing. Furthermore, unstable weather is debatable. During the Little Ice age the weather was just as erratic and dangerous if not more so than today. Floods ravaged Europe and east Asia, massive droughts spread across the west wiping out civilizations like those in the  River Valley, diseases spread across Eurasia killing over a 100 million people, droughts tore through central Asia, cold weather caused famine, and a near-total societal collapse occurred in Europe.  	31	6

2019-04-25 22:02:41	John Peric	@ Although I agree ocean acidifcation is a problem, CO2 levels will never get to such levels to cause anything else your described, literally we have no idea how much of a role CO2 is playing in the climate (probably a small one compared to numerous other factors), and you are trying to go on and make big claims like that.  	20	2

2019-04-25 07:59:54	Nimo Kali	You're all a bunch of uneducated fools it's embarrassing to read your comments. You think cities getting covered by water is the only problem? Global ing, or climate change, is going to cause catastrophic weathers that can be very destructive. Furthermore, MANY of the wild life will die. The ocean's temperature has a huge role in the ecosystem, as well as weathers. The interaction between cold oceans and  oceans makes water in our world rotate and move. When this is disrupted, it will be catastrophic. You think oxygen only comes from trees? The MAJORITY of our oxygen is generated from our oceans, by phytoplanktons. When the ocean's temperatures and acidity is disrupted (due to excess CO2 as well), then phytoplanktons appear less. Not only will less oxygen be generated, but also less food for the wild life. The food cycle of every big fish starts from these planktons. This is a huge problem, take it seriously.  	31	2

2019-04-16 19:21:43	John Peric	@hbd oh my gosh you're such a moron... 1. You're assuming CO2 is the ultimate driver inclimate. Significant? Maybe. Ultimate driver? No, far from it, minimal compared to other factors. 2. You're actually dumb enough to think our ice caps will melt thus much. Not to mention we don't even know how much CO2 is trapped in ice. However, there certainly isn't a lot, because: 1.) Gases exit the ice in the summer months due to sublimation. Any gas that does not escape, is slowly squeezed out by pressure under the ice. Meaning the only ice that has "significant" amounts of CO2 is at the surface within the first few meters or ten meters.  	20	2

2019-04-06 21:00:03	John Peric	@ P.S., if all the world's ice was going to melt in 2000 years, then global sea levels would be rising nearly five inches a year, well that isn't the case now is it? Sea levels are only rising 0.14 inches a year.  	31	6
2019-04-06 20:41:59	John Peric	@ Holly do you have are stupid? 1. Assuming the rate of melting in Antarctica was the same as in  (it's a lot less), it would take... A good 337,000 years to melt completely. 2. IPCC predicts that temperatures will rise only another 0.5-1°C and predicts only 0.5-2 meters of sea level rise, meaning over the course of the next 80 around 800 million people (population inflation accounted for) will have to migrate inland, that's around 17,500 people back day for the next 80 years. First of all, that is nothing, 150 people migrate to Tampa, Florida alone every day. Second of all, that would mean the global population density per square miles would be... wait for it... 167 people per square mile (roughly 4 acres of land per person. So that just blew your almarmism out of the water. But hey, let's go even further, by 2150 we are targeted to peak at 550-600 ppm (450-400 ppm lower than the peak of the Cretaceous period), 2-4°C, and roughly a 5 meter rise in sea levels. However, the human population is targeted to drop to 2-5 billion people due to the demogic transition, meaning our global population density will have dropped to 35 people per square mile, or roughly 16 acres per person (a plot of land 900 feet wide and long). 3. You fail to realize CO2 isn't even remotely the main driver of our climate, that title goes to the Sun. For the past 60 years we've seen a slow down in solar activity, for the past 20 years we've seen little ing if any ing (likely because of this slow in solar activity). NASA predicts we could be on the brink of a Maunder minimum like period, where solar activity and sun spot counts could reach near zero. If this happens, you can basically bet on the entire world cooling by 1°C (offsetting the next 100 years of ing). 3. You fail to realize that plant growth has surged because of increased CO2 and ing. Globally, plant growth has increased 30% since the 1980s, our output of crops per square unit of land has increased by 34%. As of right now deserts like the Saharah are actually greening, over all, the Earth has actually gotten greener. Which raises another point. 4. By 2150 CO2 concentration will likely be plummeting and so will global temperatures. At the rate we're heading, by 2150, when CO2 peaks at 550-600 ppm and temperatures peak at 2-4°C, plant growth could be nearly 200% higher than it was in the 1980s (3x higher). Combine that with the increasing size of forest-supporting area and you can get some astonishing results. If we were to replant all our forest, we could possibly sea 1.9 trillion tons of CO2 get sucked out of the air within 10-40 years (off setting 40 years of pumping CO2 in the air today). Once again your almarmism is irrational. 5. Where we are at now, we can easily support 8.5-9 billion people with our food supply. By 2100, even more so, especially considering rising temperatures, CO2 levels, and are of arable land. So no, we are not in a state of over population, and we likely won't reach a state of over population.  	31	2
2019-04-06 16:39:17	Holly Hales	Actually, scientists predict that all of earth’s ice will have completely melted in only a couple thousand years. Humans will definitely still be around. And the human population on earth has been skyrocketing, so many MANY people will die when that happens... also, migration?? We’ve only got one inhabitable planet, and there’s too many people to fit on the non-flooded pieces of land. Where do you think they should migrate to????  	31	6
2019-04-04 11:16:08	John Peric	@ quit a bit of Florida would still be above water, probably a hundred square miles or so, and that's assuming all the worlds ice melted, which will not happen, especially within the next few million years. Not to mention, "casualties"? 1. This isn't going to happen. 2. If it did it would kill people, there's this thing called migrating.  	5	6
2019-04-03 23:23:48	Holly Hales	It’s a LOT more land than it looks. All of Florida, New York City, and Washington DC will be under water, and that’s much less damage than say, Africa or  . That’s insanely MASSIVE casualties.  	1	3

The crust floats on a phere on molten rock. At the current level of water to ice, the crust is pushed down by the emense weight of the water over it. I dare anyone to say that the surface of the earth would not be subject to these forces and changed by them.      I am not saying that the topogical and ocean's reactions would not product dramatic effects; effects that could disrupt human life and civilization, but I would bet any amout of money, by the time l the ice is melted at the poles and its weight is redistribted around its middle there will result more changes that filling a bathtub.  	31	6

Because the water still has the same weight per volume when its frozen= the ice already takes up the same volume as if it would have been water = the sealevels will not rise if the ice melts  	5	6

2019-03-23 03:11:07	John Peric	@ as a Californian, I can say you are in denial of how trashy of a state California is, especially when compared to the rest of the U.S. It is the third dumbest state, it has the largest homeless population, it has the lowest average quality if life, it has the highest poverty rate, it has the highest dept, it has some the *world's* filthiest cities (i.e San Francisco), it has the largest slums in the U.S., some of which are the filthiest in the world (again San Francisco), the state has the highest tax rate (but for some reason everything the government provides there sucks), it has one of the worst public school system, highest cost of living in the country, the largest economic divide in the country, it has some of the worst infrastructure in the country, and it's economy is literally a massive bubble that's going to explode, starting with the death of the tech industry in silicon valley, followed by the  of tourism and film, and lastly followed by the agriculture industry which will due with a whimper. California is a trashy state, and no better than a that Rd world country on the brink of collapse  	29	5

2019-01-31 11:36:04	DRW	Sea based ice melting would drop sea level ( water expands when frozen) whilst land based ice melting might actually create a verticle shift on some of the plates through weight displacement. But since we are now heading into a the next solar minimum . The risk of this happening is miniscule. Any reduction in arctic sea based ice has actually been off set by rapid expansion of the antarctic ice and antarctica has had record snowfall. Yet still remains the driest continent on the planet.  	5	6
2019-02-08 06:04:30	BenjaminFranklin99	@DRW You mix actual facts and nonsense in a huge jumble. I don't know if you are just another paid Koch propagandist or a kook, but it's not about the sun's output. It's about the greenhouse effect that causes the planet to retain more of the sun's energy. I get my climate facts from NASA.  	20	2
2019-02-07 13:16:56	DRW	@ no mate. I'm not. The earth 10,000 years ago had sea level 400 feet lower than it is today before the ice age melt down( most of which was the northern hemisphere). There is not only archeological evidence and fossil record , there is also ice till, ice core samples that show our atmosphere at 5000pmm of co2 at times in the planets history and plant life flourished, also minerals such as coal, gas and oil under antarctica. This is an indication that ot was once lush rainforest and the poles had zero ice on them. Lake titticacca sit thousands of feet above sea level bit has species of sea horse in it. That mountain range formed from volcanic activity and upwelling of magma pushing on the plates. When the magma pressure build up enough pressure, it pushes one plate under the other on a subduction zone this causes rapid shift and rise of a plate. You have to remember we are still in an interglacial period. Everyone forgets that as water in our oceans increase, so does precipitation over land through evaporation of sea water. Also 90% of the worlds ice is in antarctica . It has a mean temp of minus 30 degrees celsius on a good day down to minus 45 deg celsius due to wind chill factors and is colder for 6 months of the year when it is in darkness down to minus 80 degrees celsius. I don't know about yourself , but I was taught that fresh water freezes at 0 degrees celsius.  water has a much lower freezing point depending on concentration of salinity. That is why any fresh water melt from hot springs and natural thermal venting in Antarctica is actually causing sea ice expansion as the fresh water hits salt water. You also have to take into account convection currents that reverse between day and night exchanging er air over land circulating over the oceans and returning during day time. Also there is still a hole in the ozone layer over antarctica that allows a fairly cold polar vortex to come down and increase the wind chill factor. That is why it is the coldest and driest place on the planet. Sea level rises at 3mm per year and has done for the last 150 years of written records. It is not speeding up. It has stayed the same. The data from noaa and nasa satellites can not be relied on because they use radar reflection for ocean height. Waves are different and alter constantly. The wave tops actually throw the readings out. You need to look at shipping ports and harbours for accurate water levels over time.  ice is 4 km thick , thats true. But it is still knowhere near the volume of antarctica . Which never gets above freezing point. Also the arctic circle is cyclicle and melts then returns every year without causing world wide catastrophe. Stop listening to Al gores bullshit. The ipcc are a political body and have zero credibilty. You may want to look at the heartland institute and the 31,000 + scientists across a variety of feilds that started a petition in 1998 to say there has never been a consensus regarding anthropogenic global ing. Real science states that nothing is proven, nothing is above theory, science is never settled and concensus is NOT science! That's a popularity contest. Correlation of Data , physical evidence , repeatable but falsifiable experimentation and collection of non biased results is how science works. Not formulating an experiment using computer models to predict future weather events . uter models use data from events that have historically occured in the past and predict hurricanes etc. They search for similarities in pressure troughs and wind direction using past record. These ipcc climate con artists are claiming all the events we are seeing have never happened before , so how can they be using past data to form the simulation models ? Simple..... tre making up the numbers and adjusting to the level of threat they think will happen with zero data. Al gore predicted no ice at the nth pole by 2012. The climate models are wrong, he was wrong, the bogus hockey stick g was wrong and misleading by removing the medieval  period and the maunder minimum then removed the dalton minimum, then forgot to mention the highest co2 output of the 20th century was between 1940 to 1975 and this was actually a cooling period in the last 150 years. Maybe you need to go back and have a look at some history books as well as some science books? The sun drives our climate . We have zero control over that. That is not to say mankind is not polluting with real chemicals , rubbish and plastics that damage the eco system. But naturally occuring co2 is just 3.6% of the Green house gases that keep us alive. In our total atmosphere at 400ppm that equates to 0.0004% of our total atmosphere. Water vapour makes up 96% of the ghgs.  	31	2

2019-01-30 23:10:01	Jim Wymore	This is completely bogus! Ice loses volume when it melts. All the ice in the water would melt first and the water level would go down. They’re just aint that much ice left on land that would add to the water volume to make up for the wall volume loss by the melting ice in the water. This is just more climate change bullshit.  	5	6
2019-01-30 21:55:38	Raymond Knight	only a theory where the extra would pool would not be as evenly distributed in my opinion and I think the majority of the flooding would be in the southern hemisphere. This video also showed a more serious flooding in america than anywhere else.  	5	3
2019-01-30 21:09:39	bimbamjam	If all the ice melted it would dilute the salinity of the world's oceans. This would cause a higher rate of water evaporation which in turn would produce higher amounts of rainfall, hurricanes etc. Global temperatures would drop & we'd have global cooling. Eventually the ice would return. Don't worry though, the human race will long be extinct before these events happen.  	5	6

2019-01-28 23:13:58	The Man Machine	Not disputing the science here, but I'm curious as to why the three main Great Lakes increase in size at 2:11, seeing how there is no year-round ice at or near them, and they sit far above sea level (Lake, Superior = 600 ft above sea level, MI & Huron = 577 ft above sea level....far higher than a worst-case ice-melt scenario). Is it perhaps due to the increased Canadian meltwater feeding tributaries?  	5	6

Climate Change is not man made, the SUN has more effect on the earth than man will ever imagine. Currently we are heading into a rather long COOLING period. It started with the SUN going into Solar Min two years ago only this time there are other factors influencing the typically 12 year solar cycle. Watch the , watch the spring planting being pushed back further and further into spring. It happened last spring planting in the US and else where. Crop outputs were down significantly. Ice build up in the arctic and on  is on the rise not the opposite.  	20	2

2019-01-26 19:08:12	Robert Bellina	"Two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity; and I'm not sure about the universe."   \- Albert Einstein      I'll go out on a limb here, and say 3 things:      1\. This will never happen.   2\. If it were even possible, there would be nothing humans could do to cause it to happen or to stop it from happening. The Sun is the sole arbiter of the climate on this planet, and we have no control over it.   3\. Videos such as this do not take into account that 90% of the Earth's ice is already underwater. They mathematically determine the total mass of ice and extrapolate the effect of it all melting into current ocean levels. The result is sensationalist alarmist nonsense to get the p to  up more of their money and freedom to the elites. Al Gore became a billionaire touting this stuff, yet not one of his "prophecies" have come to pass...and morons still buy into it.  	31	2
2019-01-26 18:01:56	Rob Brumfield	If water expands when it freezes then wouldn't the water level go down? Also, ice that is already in the ocean is already displacing more water than when it melts. Glaciers have been melting and growing for thousands of years. I don't see how the world would flood like in the video if all of the ice melted.  	5	6
2019-01-27 05:04:08	Jeremy Ripton	The water levels do go down when there's an abundance of Ice.....the last Ice age kept water back...in Ice form.... from.flooding the English channel and the North sea...there was a land bridge to Europe....then the melt happened..and the water moved in...its happened many, many times before all over the world.....why dont you know this?  	33	6

2019-01-26 12:07:23	Roy Oetting	This is the stupidest dishonest video on YouYube. The south pole has been capped in ice for 15 million years. Every year the north pole is recovering from one of it's low ice periods. The use of s like "irreversible" are use to scare as is "Tipping point" Tell me if you can, what has happened over the last half million years? The planet experienced 5 glacial periods and five inter-glacial periods including the one we live in now. This one is called the Holocene. What makes the Holocene different from the other inter glacial periods? The first that is obvious is that it's  period has lasted longer than any of the others but at the same time each progressive inter-glacial is cooler than the previous. The Holocene Optima lasted for about 4000 years when it was er than today. This is the period where all the modern civilizations grew and prospered. The last time the earth experienced a large sea level rise was during the Younger Dryus when it rose about 300 feet with indications that at times it rose 30 feet in one day. Lets compare that to today. The most extreme rate of sea level rise, there is some contention on this point, is 3.2 mm/ yr or a little over an inch in ten years. Scary? I don't think so. Is the planet's temperature going to continue to rise? According to en, Mann, Gore, Nye, and Tyson it is. oooh! This is all based on theories developed over the 19th century starting with Fourier. Elkhorn coined the term "Greenhouse gases" in 1901. We all should know that the greenhouse gases keep our planet at this relative temperature and without them would be considerably cooler probably with the earth ultimately becoming a snowball planet again. This would not be good unless you really have a thing for  Ice. So greenhouse gases keep the planet sufficiently  for mammals to exist but despite the past ice ages all the life today came thru them or evolved to what tre today just as man has evolved. CO2 in the atmosphere is considered a trace gas with water vapor being the primary green house gas at 95% of the green house gases but water vapor only makes up less than 5% of the atmosphere with nitrogen being the most abundant and Oxygen being second. Oxygen is required by all animals you can see with the naked eye, so it is important and it is important that it stays near the level it is. Oxygen is a byproduct of plant life which when plant life produces food it breaks down compounds that contain oxygen such as CO2 and H2O disposes it's waste Oxygen back into the atmosphere. We then along with a bunch other things convert the O2 back into other compounds such as CO2 and H2O. Neat! My point is that CO2 besides being a trace gas is that it is food for land and sea plant life. I'm going to use some rough numbers here but tren't off by much - That of all the CO2 produced each year man is responsible for something like .07 of it which represents .00014 of the atmosphere. Is this what is calling the rising of CO2 in the atmosphere or is CO2 coming out of the oceans more quickly because 800 to 1000 years ago the planet was is the medieval  period where more heat was transferred to the sea. It takes that long for the  water to circulate and to cause large amounts of CO2 to come out of solution. Time for me to take a nap so I'm going to cut this short. What is going to happen in the next 30 years? According to SS (AOC or andria Ocasio-Cortez) we don't have to worry because we will all be dead by then. According to many scientists, we will be deep into a mini ice age similar to "The Little Ice Age" that took place 400 years ago. Why? It has been determined the energy level of the sun is variable for example the approximate 11 year cycles we keep records of but in addition to that are larger less periodic cycle such as the 400 year cycle and the 206 year cycle which would explain the Maunder Minimum ,  Minimum and the Wolfe to mention a few but it also would include the Eddy Grand Solar Minimum which started about 10 years ago and I think some are becoming aware of the more harsh northern hemisphere winters. In case you are wondering why things aren't worse it is because there other factors that cause things to change. An example of this is that the winter solstice is around 21  but the co0ld weather usually waits to January and February. That is a lag. The Modern Grand Solar Maximum took Solar Cycles 18 thru 23 to raise the temp less than 1 c. What do I think will happen in the next 30 years? Wow, I think the future will be scarier than fiction. The Sun ultimately controls the climate and if it is going to take a nap like I promised , well use your imagination. One last point. Many people assume it is the Milankovitch cycles that cause the major temperature swings but you only have to look at the gs of the last half million years to see that the earth is now over due for a glacial period. Eddy might just be the beginning. The scientists are just guessing about ing and cooling. My money is on the latter.  	31	2

2019-01-22 23:33:19	egastap	I'd love to see the raw data that this gic is based upon. I would bet that someone has calculated the gross amount of ice in both the N and S poles. Perhaps it would show a different picture if they excluded the ice which is under water and only calculate the ABOVE WATER level ice. As we all remember from our Science 101 class at high school the underwater ice will melt to have the same volume as the water that replaces it. The above-water is the ONLY ice turning into water that will be added to the oceans levels. But that woulldn't be so dramatic would it? I suspect a lot of fear-mongering as usual, but it gets the 'experts' the funding they desire and crave.......doesn't it. As I get older I get a lot more sceptical about so-called 'experts'. It was only 40 years ago the 'experts' were telling us we are entering another Ice Age. That obviously didn't get enough grant/research money, so they've found another avenue to confuse the masses. It's now OK to add climatology to the list of religions in the world. In twenty years time, they'll change the story yet again. You youngsters out there.....watch out for this and remember where you read it first.  	31	6
2019-01-27 05:29:14	Jeremy Ripton	You're so.full of yourself.....land ice and snow will cause the detrimental flooding...the Andes..the Himalayas...the Alps...and Siberia....all land Ice.....all extra....which at one point covered the Earth in a shallow sea, in a er period.....now its frozen and tied up.....you're so full of it.....  	5	6
2019-01-22 18:36:41	Bert Clayton	With all this, wouldn't it have an affect on the tectonic plates? Buoyancy of the eat the crust, washing away of the eat the crust?   Edgar Cayce mentioned land coming out of the ocean.   Could volcanoes be stimulated or vice versa?   There has to be more effects than just flooding. As evaporation would probably increase and precipitation would increase in other places.   There would have to be more effects. One effect prompting another effect.  	5	3
2019-01-27 05:33:47	Jeremy Ripton	Lol....flooding is the only effect. melting land based Ice...on mountain ranges and  and Siberia...all land based ice....melt it....and what do you get.....more water.....flooding.  	5	2

2019-03-23 01:46:15	John Peric	@ no, you got it completely wrong. To first point out, that's a hypothesis, but with that said, the population in Iceland was growing fast, so Vikings ventured further into  and set up colonies, so they could expand further. To do this, they promoted moving to  by making it sound plesent. Tccomplished their goal in establishing permanent colonies and used those colonies to expand onward into  and New England.  	37	2

The major n coastal cities such as Boston, New York, adelphia, Baltimore, Washington, Miami and Los Angels will all be gone. My solution is to get all that glacier ice that’s still on land that everyone’s worried about and build some large lakes throughout the world. Such as the “Lake of the Grand Canyon”, Lake Death Valley, not to mention just filling up the lakes we already have that are going dry!  	5	6

2019-02-10 08:51:06	Bryan Hensley	@ dig up old weather records from the early 1900s. Pick out a random city and go back and look. The weather isn't changing. Everyone was talking about California during the fires. I looked up the same date except sometime in the 1930. The average daytime highs and lows were identical. And the rainfall was identical. You'll need to look at several years to get an accurate picture. Also you'll need to look up the solar maximum and solar minimums, you'll notice they do effect our weather. It will only take you a few hours per day for a month or so. Go find out how much the government is brainwashing you. I have.  	36	2
2019-02-10 08:45:01	Bryan Hensley	@ and I have a friend who drilled a deep hole in the ocean and concreted in a pole back in the 70s. He's been keeping record of the ocean levels since. The ocean at his place has not risen 1 mm. He lives south Carolina. He's got friends who live at the ocean who have done the same thing. All of them say no rise whatsoever. One has said it's dropped some, but we have to consider the land he's on might be sinking some. I highly highly recommend everyone turn off the TV and internet and go research this stuff for yourself. Everything you know about global ing has been fed to you through the tv or Internet or someone else's publication. Coincidence? Absolutely not. Our media is brainwashing the hell out of everyone. Tre winning too. We used to hear about stuff like this in communist countries when I was a kid. Now it's here..  	31	2

These are ice cubes that are, for now, still in the freezer and not yet in the glass of water.  	5	6

2019-01-23 20:31:31	Chris Crilly	Water and ice have the same density? If that were the case, s would not float, the ice in your glass of water would settle at a random depth in your glass. Neither of these is the case. At 0° C ice has a specific gravity (what you call density) 0.9168 as compared to the specific gravity of water 0.9998 at the same temperature; a difference of 1.1%. Enough difference to cause ice to float in water. Perhaps you should study your physics before writing.  	33	6
2019-01-20 13:50:14	Bryan Hensley	It would have to  up to 212 degrees F for water to expand any noticable difference  	33	3

Informal A cold, aloof person. glacier (glāˈshər) n. A huge mass of ice slowly flowing over a land mass, formed from compacted snow in an area where snow accumulation exceeds melting and sublimation. you miss the point of everything I just told you. The North Pole has no land mass. That makes it a giant , and Antarctica has ice that is past the edge of the land mass.

2019-02-05 10:15:59	TheBlackCat viewerAccount	@ it's not irrelevant because the volume of the glaciers wood shrink as the ice melts then turns back into water. Also the only glaciers that are not afloat or the ones that sit on top of the Antarctica landmass which equate to about 30% of the total ice at the ice caps. The rest of them are afloat and mostly underwater.  	5	6

2019-01-11 03:14:02	Peter Kowalcheck	I find it hard to believe that if all of the ice melted, the oceans would rise by over 200 feet.   2/3 of the Earth is covered by water, so in order to make the oceans rise by 200 feet, there would have to be enough ice to cover all continents 400 feet deep.   And that’s before you consider that ice is less dense than water, which means that as it melts, it will take up less  than it did before.   I’m sure someone did the math on this, but I don’t understand how they could have come up with a value like 216 feet.  	5	6

It's true that water will consume lots of land, but er climates will open-up even more. The only issue I see is that we might turn Earth into another  if this trend continues.  	3	2

2019-01-07 08:48:20	Graphi Graphi	ice is not what causes the sea level to rise....if you put ice in a cup of water and put ice in it and let the ice mark the water level and let the ice melt than came back, youll see the water hasnt rose. global ing is what cause the water to rise. when water gets  or hot it expands and theres alot of water and alot of heat on this planet  	5	6

2019-01-07 02:54:53	Timothy Brady	Scientists say that if the polar ice caps melt the ocean water level will rise? These are scientists right? Ok I have a simple 3rd grade science test for these geniuses. Get a bucket and fill it with water, put in a block of ice and mark the water level. After the ice melts what happened to the water level? Did it A. Rise? Or B. Stay the same? Think about it.  	5	6

2019-01-07 01:11:24	S. Tapia	Fortunately there will always be a north pole and a south pole where ice will accumulate. If you have been paying attention you would know that the poles are shifting in a certain direction now for years. Causing part of the climate change panic. Losing ice in one spot and gaining in others now, but that won't be discussed in some circles.  	5	6
2019-01-07 00:51:30	Blue KY Wildcat	It may be how earth would look but since it's never going happen so what? It would take an extreme climate change for that to happen and , aside from the  Lefties, can find zero evidence to back anything like this happening.  	3	2

2019-01-06 23:58:46	Xx_ Łìł _ fłúžî _xX	Hate to break it to you guys, but If all the ice melted on earth the sea level would actually be lower than it is now because ice pushes down on the water making it higher. For example, if you fill a cup half way with water, and add ice until it reaches the top, and wait for the ice to melt, the water will be back to the halfway point, maybe a little higher. Don’t believe me? Go ahead and try it. Ice takes up more  than water, so the water level would not rise.  	5	6

The oceans have not risen in any amount to affect anyone in the past 2000 years. Now tre calling for a global cooling through 2030, due to a recession in sun flares. This will cause colder winters in the north and shorter growing seasons. Al gore should be charged with inciting the public to a lie. Anyone who believes man has any control on global temps is fooling themselves. If you wish to drive a prius, just do it because you like ugly lunch box .  	20	2

What does water do when it freezes??? that's right spanky....it EXPANDS. In other s, when it melts, it doesn't take up the same volume. Let me put it another way.....every winter we get snow. when all that snow melts, do the oceans rise??? no. they don't. start thinking for yourselves. ugh.... :(  	5	6

2019-02-02 18:03:51	Random Person	@Bdkj3e what you say is not true. If you can show me evidence of CO2 levels 'many times higher' during the ice ages then I'll reconsider, also you have to take into account things like Milankovitch cycles which are suspected to contribute to ice ages, but those take place over tens of thousands of years not 50 years so they don't explain current ing. The idea that plants will be benefited is also not true,  the-experts-does-rising-co2-benefit-plants1/ as is the idea that CO2 levels have been decreasing (Google CO2 level ppm since 0 ad and look at the third image).  	20	2
2019-02-02 17:48:02	Bdkj3e _	@ then how can you explain ice core samples throughout history that show the exact opposite? Co2 levels many times higher than tre now even though the world was in the middle of an ice age and different periods where co2 was much lower but almost no ice anywhere, just 10,000 years ago most of the northern hemisphere was cover with ice yet the co2 levels where basically the same. If anything Humans putting more carbon into the atmosphere is literally SAVING the planet as the co2 levels had been dropping steadily and we're approaching the levels that plants start starving. Between 100-150 ppm of carbon dioxide is the limit for the majority of plants to start starving and growing significantly slower, we were right around 175ish ppm levels at the beginning of the industrial revolution and now they've reached 400, doubled the levels yet what you call "significant" ing is no more than a couple degrees which is probably within the margin of error considering the accuracy of the measurement's using the technology of 200 years ago. Also the main answer that governments have come up to supposedly combat these problems all has to do with money so it shouldn't come as a surprise that governments would come up with a new scheme to tax people more.  	20	2
2019-02-02 16:49:52	Random Person	The only way to explain the consistent global temperature increases throughout the last 50 years is the corresponding rapid rise in CO2. The rate of ing at the moment is unprecedented throughout the Earth's history. We know it's not the Sun for two reasons: one, an 11 year solar cycle would mean variations over an 11 year period, not consistent increases over a 50+ year period. Second, it has been established science for over 100 years that CO2 traps heat and would cause an increase in global temperatures. There has been a huge rise in CO2 recently, and temperature is increasing because of it. Science is no longer arguing over climate change, it is no longer a subject of debate in the scienctific community. We can already see the effects (look at the video I linked). Climate change is real and it is mostly human caused.  	20	2

2019-01-31 05:25:22	Damon Wilson	@ manipulated data. Average temps have been going down. They like to laugh at you p who belive this bs so they can make money just by making shit up. "We have to save the world so lets tax double on anything that penetrates the air". Even though in reality C02 is good and keeps trees alive which provide our oxygyn. Magnetic poles are shifting and it has nothing to do with humans. You are a believer in the biggest scam in history meanwhile the midwest is experiencing record low temps😂 al Gore said florida would be under water by 2010. He sold that documentary and lives in a huge mantion off the florida coast😂😂 go eat a dick p.  	20	2
2019-01-31 05:19:06	Damon Wilson	Its fake news we are in a cooling. Avarge temp goes down every year.. Btw the midwest is seing record lows. The magnetic poles are shifting. Democrats and Governments around the world know if they make something up out of thin air like climate control 98% of the p will pay "taxes' for it to try and save the world. Meanwhile the 1% are rubbing their hands together and laughing at fools like you who buy into this shit.  	20	2
2019-01-27 23:59:30	QuM3	@ No there isn't. In fact its recent knowledge that the math they used was done using a closed eco system for CO2 analysis with a FLAT EARTH.. the same math in a SPHERE has different data projections. Climate Change is not man made, the SUN has more effect on the earth than man will ever imagine. Currently we are heading into a rather long COOLING period. It started with the SUN going into Solar Min two years ago only this time there are other factors influencing the typically 12 year solar cycle. Watch the , watch the spring planting being pushed back further and further into spring. It happened last spring planting in the US and else where. Crop outputs were down significantly.  	20	2

2018-12-18 03:38:58	CAGW Scam	Sea Level Rise (SLR) has been stuck at 7~10 inches per century since 1800 and this century will also be the same.      Most of the SLR since 1800 has been from ocean thermal expansion caused by the ing recovery we've enjoyed since the end of the Little Ice Age (1280~1850) in 1850.      According to NASA, Antarctic Land Ice has actually been INCREASING since ICESAT satellite data which measures land ice variance) became available in 1992:       t-greater-than-losses      's Land Ice Mass has been decreasing since 1992, but this is primarily due to 30-year /cool ocean cycles (PDO, AMO, NAO).      From around 2020, the Pacific, Atlantic and Arctic oceans will all be in their respective 30-year cool cycles, so  land ice will start increasing again. As a matter of fact, as the Arctic approaches its 30-year cool cycle, the 2017  land Ice mass increased, and it looks like 2018 ice mass also increased slightly...      The shift to 30-year ocean cool cycles will bring many decades of global cooling as we saw from 1944~1977, 1880~1913, and 1820~1850.      CO2 has had VERY little to do with SLR. It's solar activity and 30-year /cool ocean cycles which dominate 30-year /cool cycles..  	31	2

2019-01-07 21:47:44	whoisjohngalt11	@JoelTheBeardSurvivor This happens over the course of hundreds of years. It's not a tsunami. The only people who would die from this are those who think they can prop their house up on stilts and stay where tre. Depending on how the weather shifts, the US would retain the great plains and all of the food source that goes with it. Unless sea water rises enough to backflow into the Mississippi, destroying the fresh water source, and the weather changes significantly, the US would be able to survive this fairly well. We'd rebuild port cities further inland.  	31	3

Much of the Western US is almost completely empty though so there is quite a bit of  for people to move.  	3	1

2019-02-01 08:24:56	Kevin Duffey	@ We already know how to feed everyone.. its just about making the changes required to do so. Hydroponics for one.. there was an article years ago showing how we could build multi story hydroponic buildings next to food stores that could feed cities yearly with enough fresh produce, fruits, etc. But there isnt nearly enough "concern" today because we have so much farm land. A lot more of us would need to become more vegetarian though, which is a good thing despite my love of meat. :D If you have a decent sized yard, you could set up your own hydroponics and feed your family yearly. Upfront cost would be high though, but you wouldnt need much other than water and electricity after its set up, or solar if you have enough light year round.  	11	1

Right now the oceans are rising about 3mm a year, or about an inch a decade. This rate has been fairly constant for the last 150 years, at least the folks at NASA have shown in a couple of their gs.      2) Banks are in the business of loaning money and holding collateral to secure the loan. Do banks hire experts to assess the risk of an asset, i.e. property, before making a loan. Of course they do. Have you heard about any bank not making loans on any coast or in the State of Florida because of the risk of rising oceans? Nope.  	31	2

2018-11-11 05:23:25	e v	Why don't we recut/drudge/enlarge, from side-ditches, brooks, creeks, rivers, ponds, lakes, etc? Cut down on flooding and reclaim some very rich soil. Billions are being spent on "oceans rising". There are probably billions of gallons of water that could be stored in deeper inland water ways. Multiply that over all the land of the world. The land excavated could be used to shore up the coastal areas. Also doesn't erosion of the land add more silt to the oceans? Plus the displacement of water from all the waste/wrecks in the ocean? Volcanic activity spewing rock into the oceans? Dubai built whole islands in the Arabian Sea's Gulfs. Wouldn't it all factor into the oceans rising not just glaciers melting?  	11	3

Own up and move on. Stop hanging onto something that's been debunked at least two different times.  	20	6
2019-01-24 21:25:58	helmutt sandiego	@ stupid comment Bryan. Ice that is on land will displace the volume into the ocean. Do some research and then think. It might surprise you. Ice on  will INTO the ocean and the weight reduction on that island may make the tectonic plate rise displacing more water and cause rise.  	5	6

2018-10-01 17:34:38	Skeeter Saurus	The NUMBER ONE PROOF that there is no Climate Change, and that the world's oceans will not rise: If EITHER were an actual threat, the elite of the world would have already made it a TOP PRIORITY to shut down existing global cities and MOVE THEM INLAND! NYC would be closing, as 'New Denver' would be quadrupling in size yearly! That there has been ZERO EFFORT to move one major metropolis inland to higher ground and obsolete an old coastal city is PRIMA FACIA EVIDENCE that 'Climate Change' and 'Sea Rise' is nothing but political spin for the objective of profiteering over 'green technology'!   If I live in a flood zone, and the water KEEPS RISING, I'm either going to elevate my house, or move inland to higher ground...It's JUST COMMON SENSE, people! The rich elite run the world, and aren't making this move...which means that they have NO INTEL telling them this is a viable threat!  	31	2

2018-10-01 14:25:34	đeri662	I think everybody should agree that global ing is true, the question is: is it caused by human activity? In my opinion, everyone should be sceptic about the things that we hear on tv, youtube etc. I'm a sceptic and I have some questions:   1) According to NASA, about half of the 20th century ing happened until 1940 and after the 2. WW (and economy boom that followed the war) the planet was actually cooling until about 1980. There is no correlation between temperature and atmospheric CO2 so there had to be another reason for that, so why should we think CO2 emissions are the number one reason now?   2) We now have approx. 410 ppm of CO2 in the atmosphere. That represents only 0,041 % of the air molecules. Water vapor in the troposphere varies between 1 and 4 % of air molecules and is a stronger greenhouse gas. So does CO2 contribute a part worth mentioning in trapping of heat in the atmosphere?  	20	2

2018-10-20 13:19:24	nastatchia	You are right of course it is, and you are right in insisting on it because India too needs strong efforts to transfer to clean energies (and not nuclear...). But it certainly is not on the level India and the subcontinent is going to horribly suffer from it, and europe, usa and China are overwhelmingly more responsible for what you are going to endure. Especially the previous peasants who have been thrown out of their lands by GMO and pesticides already. And I am speaking as one from these country, therefore what I am saying.  	30	2

2018-10-20 00:39:30	nastatchia	The worst is that it is absolutely not your fault. India is a massive greenhouse gas emiter, but a very meager consummer per capita so actually Indians are part of the least greenhouse gas emitters in the world. This is outrageous, and even if we stopped emitting GG now it would still have effects. Plus this is not showing the melting of glaciers, which would threaten access to water to a particularily horrifying extent in the whole indian subcontinent.  	20	2

In the arctic circle of Alaska even in the mid section of alaska there has been changes to how we view both the sun and moon and AND the animals know best for their migration routes are changing followed by subsistence hunters. Animals speak softly and only those who listen to them and follow the stars at night know that nature is altering.   If simply weather change than what the animals say means NOTHING!  	31	2

If a rubber duck were in a bathtub and you add more water, the water doesn't rise above the duck, the duck just floats at a higher level.  	5	6

2019-01-07 21:27:01	ShmuelWeintraub	When all the ice has melted there will be no permanent snow pack in the rockies... meaning most of the western plains in both  and the US will effectively become deserts (the parts that aren't currently). Most of the cities are built on glacier fed rivers... and those water sources will no longer be available. Also, when the permafrost melts (which it is doing right now) in the arctic, tens of thousands of years of organic matter will begin decomposing... releasing massive quantities of greenhouse gases. Much of this material will turn into something close to peat... which when dried will burn ferociously... something the boreal forests are already doing to a much greater extent than they were just 25 years ago. So moving to  and the US are really not the answer... and there is no real answer. If the human race still exists in 2119, it will have a total population of less than 2 Bn units.  	31	6

2018-10-21 04:31:07	triple a	Global ing is cause by the increase of greenhouse gases in the air, which have experienced a sudden spike in the last 200 years along with the industrial revolution. The average climate temperature does fluctuate annually, but not in a drastic and continuous rise like it has been doing for hmmmm, coincidentally, the last 200 years. Greenhouse gases exist in the air naturally to keep the Earth . That is how it is able to sustain life. But when we do things like add carbon to the air through the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, or add methane through the domestication if cows, it releases more greenhouses gases into the air, which makes the Earth er. The longer we do this, the er the Earth will get. It’s science, not a scam, and every climatologist and environmental scientist not funded by oil companies agrees. Anyone who denies it at the point is just misinformed or ignoring the truth to make money.  	20	2

2018-11-22 07:40:26	nastatchia	​@ Well then 1) Your first comment does not make any sense, 2) The first sentence of your second one doesn't either. I actually don't know where you are going with this and if you were looking, I don't know, for me not to comment after the fact that this conversation had ended a month ago I can only advise you to look for dates of comments which are right next to the nickname. If you are putting the nickname of the person before the comment, assume that person will understand that the comment is addressed to him or her. If you are assuming that there is no purpose to comment on this well 1) don't do it yourself, 2) You do not decide for others and actually as I referred the advice of not arguying after a month that the conversation was ended grazes absurdity and 3) it does for me because writing publicly that a refugee crisis of hundreds of millions of people (and I did not comment on similar comments about Florida for example, because they were obvious jokes - even if yes they don't take in the fact that there is massive voter suppression there and no, the recently passed law is just a bandaid and didn't solve the problem at all- anyone can see that tre jokes. This one, however you look at it, is not and cannot be teasing, and the rest of his arguments speaks foritself to validate my point), leading to out of anything our species has ever experienced massive deaths of main characters of their lives like you, him and I are as "poetic" is not just offensive, it's obsene. This is I guess why another person intervened before me, and yes his poorly constructed arguments about social class, even if he didn't understand it, had to be corrected. Now, I don't believe that that person is as - sorry, but - dumb as some other commentators, but again this was not just ic, greasy and offensive, it was obsene. So yes I do consider that one has to react to that (especially when written publicly), because what we are discussing about is nothing of a fiction but again something concerning main characters of their lives, like he is. And yes, the rest of his arguments were pathetic and irrelevant. I told you already that I don't have time for this.  	31	5
2018-11-22 06:46:19	helicas	 no you just responded to my comment with the assumption that I was forwarding the argument  	38	5
2018-11-22 06:29:28	nastatchia	@ I didn't bring any new argument (first sense of the term, not a synonym of "fight"), obviously. Then why your comment " coherence much?". Are you asking me now to explain to you why I felt that I had to intervene on that comment?  	38	5
2018-11-22 06:24:15	helicas	 you brought the argument, assuming that I disagreed with you  	37	5
2018-11-22 06:02:05	nastatchia	Yeah I checked, you did not.  	25	5
2018-11-22 06:01:36	nastatchia	@ Because you brought an argument? I must have missed it.  	37	5
2018-11-22 05:56:16	helicas	 good then stop arguing. Oh and I do agree, I’m just saying that arguing over something like this isn’t worth it  	38	5
2018-11-22 05:41:05	nastatchia	@ Yes, read again if you have not understood some part. And take time to verify because I have others things to do than correct messages on the internet.  	37	5
2018-11-22 05:35:01	helicas	 coherence much?  	25	7
2018-10-20 02:24:17	nastatchia	So do not a lot of ns. Did you read ip Alston's last UN report? It is horrifying. And of course greenhouse gas emission is a social class issue. Who doesn't know that common fact?  	20	2
2018-10-20 02:11:10	James Collins	, I hope you are merely misreading my statements instead of gas lighting me. The purpose of my statement was to reveal that the per capita argument is invalid because not all Chinese live in a 21st like environment.  	14	2
2018-10-20 01:16:01	nastatchia	That's not a question  wants to ask, and it has nothing to do with global ing. If you are of those kinds who thinks that we need to get rid of some humans to stop global ing (which is an ultra right-wing out of any democratic spectrum idea and actually makes no sense if you actually study the matter), start with euro-americans so that (real) ns can finally live in peace on their land, and they know how to respect the world and nature. So called indigenous people around the world are the leaders of our species against both our existential threats.  	20	2
2018-10-20 01:03:32	James Collins	nastatchai, Your analysis is correct, even though the 4:1 ratio is high, if you use the entire Chinese population. The question  wants to ask is how many Chinese are in the 21st century vs. the 19th.  	14	0
2018-10-20 00:31:44	nastatchia	Very poetic... Hundreds of millions of refugees. Because Houston is a natural reserve? Btw, US's geenhouse gas emission is 4 times the one of China per capita, so your calculus is simply unreceivable in terms of logic and proportion. Lol , the definition you gave is of capitalism, not communism (not that China has anything to do with it).  	14	2
2018-10-11 01:06:40	James Collins	Costanza, I have disagree with you on two points. First: Communist regimes are notorious at not thinking long term when it comes to managing their environment. This became very apparent in the 1990's when Eastern Europe became an open society. Also the BBC made a documentary a few years back describing the same lack of foresight by the CCP in managing the Chinese environment. Second: Contrary to what MSM, etc., reports n industry has done a remarkable job in reducing CO2 emissions.  	20	2
2018-10-11 00:35:53	Costanza Bronzo	@ Collins what you say is true, but their emissions have started to get really high only in the last 30 years or so. And I think Chinese people want to know what it's like to be rich before they realize it's time to cut down their emissions. On the other hand, the US have been a world power for more than a century, and they've had enough time to decide to go green. But their emissions per person are still the highest in the world, and I don't think that the current administration will improve the situation. Europe and  started to pollute first, and they must stop to first. We can't blame others just because we don't want to take responsibility for our own actions.  	20	2
2018-10-11 00:24:51	James Collins	Costanza, I fear you do not appreciate the trend in the Chinese CO2 emissions, China was predicted to surpass the US in 2020 but it happened in 2009 instead. China brings on line a new coal fired power plant every week and been doing so for years. Also if you were to limit your analysis to only the Chinese living in a 21st century environment your results would be quite different.  	20	2
2018-10-10 23:27:54	Costanza Bronzo	Don't worry, the US are still the best when it comes to emissions per person.  	3	1

There are plenty of places in Mississippi and Alabama that are at lower elevations than Florida, yet Florida disappears before they do.      C'mon, man...

2018-09-20 14:39:57	Adi T	doesn't ice have more volume than liquid water? so if ALL of it melted, even ice under the water and above the water, shouldnt the water level get smaller?  	33	6
2018-10-09 07:50:48	Shaun Welch	 the ice is dense, heat expands. The water temperature itself is ing making the ocean rise because the liquid state combines with the collective, therefore the ice melting increases the total level of liquid water. Hence why most iceburgs are considerably gigantic under the tips because the density and cold increases further down in the water along with pressure upon the ice.  	33	6
2018-09-27 09:14:19	Ian moseley	Not all ice is floating - huge volumes are sitting on land especially in Antartica. Also floating ice displaces a volume related to its mass - melting it would not change the level.  	5	6

2018-09-18 18:44:24	mark putnam	Don’t get your panties in a wad yet. The alarmists idol Al Gore claimed the oceans would rise forty feet by 2020. Yet the oceans haven’t ated with uncle Al. Oh my could he have been wrong? Looks like his data was erroneous and greatly exaggerated. But the drum is still beating hard on the liberal front to save the planet from human activity. Which is causing massive changes in weather patterns resulting in more severe disasters world wide. Wildfires, drought, flooding, hurricanes and tornadoes are worse than ever because of our CO2 emissions. They claim the data is in yet they can’t explain any previous climate changes prior to human activity. Why is it that they call speculation and theory proof of their so called research findings? Considering that CO2 is plant food why is it bad for the environment? Considering we humans eat plants and that many liberals are vegetarian or some form there of. Then why the fear of CO2? So my question is why is it that industries that rely on government subsidies and donate those same funds back to politicians to promote their agenda by encouraging those same politicians to fund their biased climate studies not questioned by the liberals? It is clear that since the launch of this Green or Sustainable Energy money train that the real impact of these policies have been minimized or not reported on at all by the left leaning media. Hundreds of thousands of acres of private and public land scraped clean for solar power panels and wind farms without EIR studies. This is hundreds of thousands of acres of former plant and animal habitat that the liberals care so much about protecting from other users yet have not raised any concern over this habitat destruction. Why? How about the thousands of birds of prey killed each year by these same “Green” power farms. Many on the endangered or critical lists. Again why? Because most liberals who claim to be well educated aren’t. They merely suck up the crap fed to them by the New Socialist Democratic Party and think they’re saving the planet from the evil likes of President Trump and the Republicans. All the while selling out to the New World Order and giving up n Sovereignty, shameful.  	20	2

2018-09-18 00:59:26	Jeremy Li	Where did you get your education? You're pedaling mainstream failed science without thinking! You should pour water into a bowl close to the top and then put ice cubes in the bowl to raise the water level right up to the very edge of the bowl. You will find out that when the ice is frozen no water will run over.   You are so full of it. You're not going to hear this from the global ing uneducated and non thinking, alarmists, but you should know that water expands when it freezes. Doesn't that tell you that it occupies LESS volume after it melts, so the opposite actually happens. If the ice melts my ocean front property in Arizona will no longer be ocean front, as the shore line will go further into the ocean.   Speaking of the poles only. How is the ice at the poles going to melt anyway? Even if the temperature at the poles goes up ten degrees the amount of radiation from the Sun will not increase and therefore will remain way below zero. So, going from, let's say, 60 below zero to fifty below zero, how 's that going to melt the ice?   Science insider? Pathetic.  	31	6
2018-12-16 04:36:55	M and M Productions	 are you ok? The ice is stacked up on the land it takes up! The law of disposition makes this seem over exaggerated, but it still is a risk since more than 92 billion dollars of US property will be damages in downtown Miami alone. Miami also is a crucial region of the US as it provides tons of touristic income. It’s named cruise capital of the world and Latin n capital for a reason.  	31	6
2018-09-17 22:52:16	StarWarz #1	Ehh. Does it really matter if we lose Florida?   Puerto Rico could replace it as the 50th state  	17	1
2018-12-16 04:54:29	M and M Productions	 so you want to remove a huge producer of touristic income, more then 20 million people, the Latin n capital of the world (Miami), the cruise capital of the world (Miami), the 8th most populous US city (sonville, not by metro counting of course) not to mention all the human knowledge/ capital that would be removed, the best orange plantations in the US, Cuban  (since it would probably end up dying out), the only major city in  (that I know of) that was founded by a woman(Miami), the most diverse city (by immigrant population, Miami), and if you looked at this economically, downtown Miami is worth more then 92 billion dollars of property and real estate. In total around 750,000 properties in the Miami-Biscayne Bay Region would be lost, maybe amassing to more then 1 million and above including the tours of the Everglades and the old people of Naples. Most of the people inheriting the money of the old people in Florida live in Florida, which would remove tons in capital since the money is stored in banks in Florida. So that would crash economies by a lot. I’m Puerto Rican and sure having Puerto Rico become a state would be nice, but I’m afraid switching Florida out for Puerto Rico would be unwise.  	11	1

A government thats big enough to give you everything you want is big enough to take it all away. Historically speaking ones own government all over the world killing their own people is one of the greatest threats to humanity. Who here thinks that a one world government would actually be a good thing..its well known that un wants a major population decline worldwide  	31	2

2018-09-17 04:06:46	Da C.	So if global ing is real and are best case scenario is ocean rises by 10 feet then why are the banks giving 30 year mortgages in the affected areas that will be covered in water? See it is all a lie to make money.  	20	3
2018-09-21 08:36:13	IndianaBones	You can't be that stupid  Like bankers give a shit about the future...they just want their money now.  	38	5
2018-09-18 10:39:41	no way	The bankers don't care about the future, they can make money with money and when they give out loans, they have virtually more money, because they can count the interests on the loan plus the money they gave out as money that they have. They can then invest this virtual money into something else and they get a bonus to their salary when they give out as much loans as possible. They want money now, they don't care about what happens in the future to our children.  	31	2

If we keep on with the recent US measures taken (MH4 release, multiple new pipelines, CAFE standards repeal, new forages), we are going to live that frontally. We will live this in a smaller measure even if we stopped putting a drop of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere now. Notice that that video doesn't show in itself glaciers melting leading to a severe threat to water supply in most of the world, nor (of course) the natural catastophies's sharp increase that result from it. With the hundreds of millions of refugees crisis, and eventually the release of humanly unknown viruses and bacterias trapped under those ices for millions of years...  to chill about.  	31	2

2018-09-27 10:11:13	András Ács	@ Everyone believes what they wish. I don't claim to know for sure the universe and its inflation isn't the work of God, Sheeva or . But I'm not claiming to know what or who and why did it, either, and cannot take those who do seriously. We probably cannot ever know or comprehend how the "nothingness" came to be and I am somewhat at peace with that. The current best model of reality we have is the inflation (or big bang). It says nothing whatsoever about there being god(s) or not. I don't mind religion at all, but when it's about the lives of every being on Earth in the future, the people making policy better not be blind to the realities.  	35	2

2018-09-23 04:20:15	Joshua Werner	@ so instead of actually learning anything about climate change or sience you just listen to whatever is put out by some group and assume you know better than them. You probably have no idea how even a single weather system works yet you watch Al Gore's presentation and think that makes you qualified to talk on the subject?  	20	2

2018-09-20 15:43:18	Glen Waldrop	It is an order of magnitude faster because the data has been altered. Medieval  period, the heat wave of the early 1900s (1930s if memory serves), the cool period of the 60s and 70s has been doctored so the numbers look worse... You don't "correct" measured data in science. You get enough data so that the outliers are negated by the volume of data. "Correcting" the data completely negates the scientific method. Another tidbit, why do all of the corrections make the ing look worse? Surely some of the data must have been wrong in the *other* direction, right? Further, consensus isn't science. Science is repeated observations or tests, not "Well, all of my friends agree with me, so we're correct."  	20	2

2018-09-18 02:50:57	Schulzy	@ I don't even read conservative propaganda, I read liberal propaganda and criticize it. Funny how you accuse me of "making claims" when I'm not the one blaming nature's cycles on human actions. Maybe you should be a little more critical of everything you hear, instead of believing everything from the media. Our hottest recorded day was almost 100 years ago. If the Earth was heating up at an alarming rate, don't you think we would have beaten that record by now? Why has the ice in Antarctic grown in the past 10 years? Why was a global ing research ship stalled by unexpected ice? (That last one was mostly for humor) Be a little more critical.  	20	2
2018-09-18 00:06:24	Clerisvaldo Nogueira	you see conservative conservitard, it never was a consensus that the earth is going to freeze soon, and 7 trees don't cover the emissions of 1 car for 1 year, and even if it did, we have several things that polute more than , like factories, cow fart(i know it's weird), and there is several studies and evidence that the earth is heating faster, you should stop seeing only conservative propaganda on the internet and checking reliable sources to make these claims  	20	2
2018-09-17 23:44:37	Schulzy	@ evidence? Not long ago it was common consensus among scientists that the Earth was going to soon freeze. The number of trees should easily account for all our emissions, unless you city people have really cut down that many trees. 7 trees accounts for the emissions of 1 car for 1 year. Deforestation would be the only plausible way to accelerate the Earth's heating, and ironically you city dwelling environmentalists would be largely responsible for that. Still though, there is no evidence that the Earth is heating faster, only gical representations made using inadequate factors.  	20	2
2018-09-17 23:33:04	Clerisvaldo Nogueira	of course not, we're to blame for accelerating this one several times fold by using the resources like there is no tommorrow, it's consensus among scientists. The people that say otherwise are just doing political propaganda so they can get richer by exploiting the planet's resources  	20	2
2018-09-17 23:18:56	Schulzy	@ are we to blame for every other cycle of ing and cooling that has been going on for hundreds of millions of years?  	20	2
2018-09-17 22:25:58	Clerisvaldo Nogueira	@ well I didn't say you did, I asked you, and yes humans are to blame for it  	37	5
2018-09-17 22:21:43	Schulzy	@ please point out where I denied global ing. And yes, feminists are hilarious, especially the fat ones that dye their hair green and believe there's a gender wage gap  	20	2

2018-09-17 19:37:08	András Ács	@ We did cause it. It's just the fact, anyone denying it at this point is disingenious or misled by oil interests. The question is only what we do or won't do about it. And only we can, as ferrets, dolphins, spiders and holy spirits can't.  	20	2
2018-09-17 17:14:54	Schulzy	@Meher Yash nothing we can do about it considering it isn't human caused  	26	1

2018-10-03 10:27:06	Ren Abarca	The sea level will rise to 60 meters. Some shoals and islands will disappear, along with the coastal areas and lowlands. But Majority of the ippines will be safe as the archipelago is generally hilly and mountainous. But in Metro Manila, around 90% will become underwater. The western part of Muntinlupa city will be spared due to having an average elevation of 60 meters above sea level with some hilly areas that reaches more than 80-90 meters, but the small eastern lowland strip of the city where the most commercial districts and residential areas are located will be wiped out. Some areas of liches might be safe too as it sits on the La Mesa plateau. Manila, Pasay, Malabon, Navotas, Valenzuela, Las Pinas and others will become a haven for fishes.  	30	3

2020-01-02 10:31:48	jamie martin	@ your a smart person. explain this then according to flat earth there is no curvature to the planet right yet get into a airplane at 35000 ft you can see curvature. with your own eyes as you fly from the usa to australia say. stay 20 hours in a plane that curvature follows the entire journey oh but wait i am a paid actor according to your flat earth theories (i wish lmao)  does not exist. it cant exist, or the ice wall or no wall theory does not work. so rather than believe in curvature they refuse to accept there is a problem with the theory and just call ns lairs and actors i have been around most of australia now by car and planes it does exist lol it is whole it is not part of a country i have flown from australia to the usa and back from the usa to australia to be with my partner in the year 2017 i flew from australia to the uk and went as far north as iceland my partner flew to meet me from new york to the uk and iceland one of us should not have reached iceland right. we should have fallen of the planet and the system of global positioning system (GPS) which every map and programs use cant work if satellites cannot rotate around the globe right. so if i am correct which is experienced, so it is fact not theory, how can the earth be flat? i challenge you and all flat earth believers to get into a plane see the curvature for yourself then continue to believe in flat earth oh and to those who say "oh it is because you cant see to the edges of the planet" the sun and moon are beyond the edge yet we see them so if the earth is flat every person who has ever flown would have seen the edges and converted to your theory yet no flat earth believing people........ fly i wonder why.....  	35	2

2019-10-18 10:13:14	Rohail Aitzaz	@ Well you want proof that the Earth is not flat? Well first let me tell you that the Earth is not actually spherical it is sort of a potato or an egg shape (not completely though) this is because all of the upper and lower parts of the Earth So it is not a complete sphere but if you see it from a distance at  it would look like a sphere Debunking Flat Earth Proof#1: LUNAR ECLIPSE Solar eclipses get all the attention, but if you are able to catch a glimpse of a lunar eclipse, you can see evidence that the Earth is, indeed, round. Here's how it works: Earth passes between the moon and sun, so that the sun projects Earth’s shadow onto the  in the night sky. You've probably seen a partial lunar eclipse without even noticing it; if the moon looks orange, that's a sign of a lunar eclipse. If you've ever seen a total lunar eclipse, you probably noticed that the shadow did not look like this.A round shadow crossed over a round object. This does not sound like a thing that would happen if we were on a plane with all of the celestial bodies simply hovering overhead—or, perhaps more assinine, if the sun were orbiting Earth and not vice versa. Proof#2: SUNSET Pick a nice spot from which you can watch a sunset (we'll call this point A). Ideally, you'd have a clear horizon in front of you, and behind you would be some sort of elevated point that you can quickly access (a hill, a building with at least two floors, or perhaps the aforementioned tree; we'll call this point B). Watch the sunset from point A, and once the sun is out of sight, hurry on over to point B. With the added elevation provided by point B, you should be able to see the sun above the horizon. If Earth were flat, the sun would not be visible at any elevation once it had set. Because Earth is round, the sun will come back into your line of sight. If you don't have a hill, you could even try lying on your stomach to watch the sunset and then standing up to get a higher line of sight. Proof#3 TIME ZONES According to a 2008 paper in Applied Optics by  K. Lynch, the curvature of the earth becomes somewhat visible at an elevation of 35,000 feet (with a >60° field of view) and more easily visible at an elevation of 50,000 feet. So if you're on the right commercial flight, you might be able to see the curvature of the earth with your own two eyes. In the event that you're not high enough, though, you can still experience the curvature of the earth another way. For example, if you were to fly all the way around the world, you'd find that it would be nighttime in part of the world and daytime in another part. In that way, the existence of time zones itself is proof that the Earth is round. Taken another way, you wouldn't even need to travel through different time zones. Time zones are wide enough that you will see the sun rising and/or setting later in the western part of a time zone than in the eastern part. According to the Farmers' Almanac, the sun will rise and set roughly four minutes later for every 70 miles you drive from east to west. If you wanted to combine this experiment with the previous one, you could note how much more of Earth you can see when you begin your ascent into the air than you can while you are sitting on the tarmac waiting to take off. Proof#4 SHADOWS Pick two locations that are some distance apart (at least a couple hundred miles from each other and on the same meridian). Grab two sticks or dowels (or other objects) of equal length, two tape measures, and a friend. Each of you will take one stick/dowel/object and one tape measure to your location, stick the object into the ground, and measure the shadow. (For accuracy, you should both take your measurements at the same time of day.) On a flat Earth, the shadow that is cast by each would be of the same length. However, if you and your friend compare notes, you'll find that one shadow was longer than the other. That's because, due to the curvature of Earth, the sun will hit one part of Earth at one angle and another part of Earth at a different angle even at the same time of day. This experiment has been around since about 240 B.C., when Greek mathematician Eratosthenes compared the shadows cast in both Syene—now Aswan, Egypt—and andria on the summer solstice. Eratosthenes had learned of a well in Syene where once a year on the summer solstice, the sun would illuminate the entire bottom of the well and tall buildings and other objects would not cast a shadow. However, he noticed that shadows were being cast on the summer solstice in andria, so he measured the angle of the shadow and found it to be an angle of about 7.2°. --- I think that is enough but if you want more proof well be my guest.  	35	2

2019-07-14 21:03:04	Ember D-L	 from my understand scientists do not know where the laws of physics come from.

Just because we don’t know how something came to be does not mean that we do not know that it is there.  	37	2

2019-07-14 20:46:21	Ember D-L	 question 8 (actually 9) Why did Buzz Aldrin say he had never been to the moon. Answer: It seems to me that it was a grammatical error. He said “We didn’t go there, and that’s the way it happened.” That does sound quite damming on its own. However, in context it makes sense why he said that. Girl asks: Why has  been to the moon in such a long time? Buzz responds: ha, that’s not an 8 year olds question, that’s MY question. I want to know. But I think I know. Because we didn’t, go there and, and that’s the way it happened, And if it didn’t happen it would be nice to know why it didn’t happen so in the future if we want to keep doing something, we need to know why something stopped in the past that we wanted to keep going. Clearly this man isn’t very eloquent. When he said “because we didn’t, go there and, that’s the way it happened” it very much sounded like he was trying to say “We didn’t end up going back and it would be nice to know why.” Obviously because of the way he ed this answer it makes things quite ambiguous. I completely understand why you interpreted it they way you did. However I don’t think he meant it like that. However, this of course is completely a matter of opinion. Because of this I don’t think it’s very good evidence for an argument for, or against the moon landings actually happening.   	35	2
2019-07-14 20:31:23	Ember D-L	 Question 7 (actually 8) Astronauts supposedly go to  fairly often. How come they have only taken one photo of a full view of earth? Answer: I answered that in a previous comment.  	35	0
2019-07-14 20:28:50	Ember D-L	 Statement, rockets can not work without oxygen, therefore they can not work in . Response: Since there is no air in , rockets need to take oxygen with them into . Inside the rocket's engine, fuel and oxidizers are ignited in the combustion chamber, creating hot, expanding gases. That gas has pressure, and it pushes harder against the top of the rocket than the bottom, making it go up or forward. Since the fuel is burning, exhaust is released out the bottom. Simple response: They take the Oxygen with them.  	33	2
2019-07-14 20:20:26	Ember D-L	 Question 6 (actually 7) Why haven’t you produced a real answer and instead fight with me and only use opinions and not evidence? Answer: That does not apply to me. However I would assume they didn’t bother because they believe your world view is so ridiculous and has been proven wrong so many times that they didn’t feel there was any point even bothering to.  	38	2
2019-07-14 20:17:43	Ember D-L	 question 5 (actually 6) do you question nothing? Answer: Science and skepticism is all about asking questions. That’s the whole point. We do ask questions. For example, What shape is the earth? Answer: There is overwhelming evidence that suggest it’s round.  	35	2
2019-07-14 20:15:14	Ember D-L	 Question 4 (which is actually question 5) why can’t any of you produce an unedited photo of earth? Answer: We can. However it’s very hard to get full photos of earth because of the distance you have to go up in order to get the full thing in the cameras field of view. Very few  crafts go that far away from earth so astronauts don’t get very many opportunities to get full photos of earth. Because of this they usually take a few photos of different parts of earth and put them together to make a whole view of one side of earth. Because of this they weren’t able to take a whole photo until 43 years after the  photo.  image-in-decades-of-the-whole-earth/  	35	2
2019-07-14 20:02:12	Ember D-L	 Question 4, how come the moon reflects the light of the sun even when we can’t see the sun. Answer: Here’s a visual representation. Notice she can see the light reflection of the moon when the light bulb is not in her field of vision. Simple answer: light bounces.   	35	5
2019-07-14 19:51:53	Ember D-L	 question 3, what is gravity? Answer: Gravity is most accurately described by the general theory of relativity (proposed by Albert Einstein in 1915) which describes gravity not as a force, but as a consequence of the curvature of time caused by the uneven distribution of mass.  	35	5
2019-07-14 19:44:48	Ember D-L	 question 2, why do we not fall off? Answer: Gravity  	35	5

2019-07-14 16:07:12	Ember D-L	 Why are you even asking for a real picture. No matter what your shown you will say it’s fake. This is a real picture from  11.   	8	5
2019-07-14 16:01:45	Ember D-L	 Do you seriously not have any idea how perspective works? Perspective actually is common sense mate. The further something moves away the smaller it looks. That’s why when someone draws something that’s supposed to look far away they draw it smaller. “The sun's diameter is about 400 times larger than that of the moon – and the sun is also about 400 times farther from Earth. So the sun and moon appear nearly the same size as seen from Earth.” It’s very, very simple maths.  	35	2
2019-07-14 15:58:01	Ember D-L	 it is not common sense that the world is flat.  	35	2

Is it all just flat discs then? I guess the stars are just drawn on a canvas to fool us? Or better yet, a big tv screen since it all moves and so clearly you can see spheres in a telescope?  is cheese too then? All the conspiracies are true then. Jeez! There's a BIG difference between a skeptic and a cynic. You are a cynic. You don't belive the "establishment" no matter what. A skeptic investigates and trust those of expertise. It is funny how trailer trash like you believe tre philosophers in todays internet age. The more information humans have at their hands, the less they know. What a bunch of monkeys we are.

2019-05-03 19:35:47	john Griffin	LOL I was wondering the same thing if all the ice especially the ice surrounding this Flat Earth were to melt there would be no barrier wall to contain the water and it would just drift off into outer  or whatever they think's going to happen. I have often wondered what the water look like Bureau that big ice wall that it's trying to contain. Ice will float and it also melts so the ice that is circling this big flat disk is also covering the equator area and I'm surprised that ice hasn't already melted and open the spicket for the rest of the water to seek its own level which water will do so that pretty much blows the total idea that the Flat Earth people have been pitching for the last 5 or 10 years. How foolish !!!  	31	6

2019-03-13 11:07:28	triggered	@ Gravity is a force. It is created by the mass of objects in an orbit. There, just told you what it was. This is why you are able to lay in bed and go to sleep. In  where there is no gravity, you never feel that sensation of sleeping because there isn't a force that is pulling you down. This is why when balls bounce, it transfers the potential energy into sound and thermal energy. It can't do that if there isn't a force (gravity) pulling them toward the ground in order to transfer the potential energy. That is why when you climb things, the higher you go, the more GPE (Gravitational Potential Energy) you have. If you climb a mountain it gets harder to go higher up because or gravity and tour GPE increases. If you fall from a mountain, you lose all of that GPE and it turns into kinetic energy (KE) when you fall. Right before you reach the ground, the KE is zero then changes into the amount that you started with. That is why when you hit the ground from a high place, you die. I don't know if you ever had the chance to even pass the first year of high school, but even if you had the smallest crumb of a brain you wouldn't be so simple minded and believe in the flat earth and be anti gravity. There is so much gravity does to hold this world together and there are millions of peices of evidence pointing to so. You keep telling people to look up the flat earth information theirselves, yet you keep asking for photos. You should look that up yourself too. This isn't the 15th century anymore. Grow up.  	35	2

2019-03-04 11:48:35	NoNiche	@ okay what if i beleive you freddie, but you also said dont beleive things because you were told to, so should i beleive you? And im sure you weren't born knowing that the earth was flat or round so someone must have told you that it is, but then again you said dont beleive the things that you were told to, and you are not the only one who made experiments to prove what you beleived, so you have to give others credit too, scientist, astrologist, astronauts, and many more, and from what i think all of your questions and argument was already answered, you can even google it. But in reverse, the questions on the world is flat lacks evidence, did you already gone to the edge of the flat earth beyond the ice walls or touched the dome that you claim. For any reason that you havent, or would even say impossible, then dont go about calling people  and tell them dont beleive what your told to because you have never lived your proof, cause i think you are that person. Becuase we have astronauts, scientists, astrologist and many more that can argue with you and will not lose, because they will never say they were Just told to or who knows because its impossible or someone or something is preventing you to know, becuase they lived it and thats proof.  	35	2

2018-10-18 00:32:18	R A	yheaa! all those stupid people who believe that the earth is round! they only believe it because someone has told them. but  on the other side has invented the flat earth theory all by himself!  has made him believe that the earth is flat, no... he had found it out all by himself. on top of that he even invented it after all! because he has seen it with his one eyes through all the research he has done. a true scientist and professor, that boy named . because he went to heith a big air balloon (the air balloon was also flat by the way) and when he was so high that he could sit on the moon (a flat moon) he saw with his one eyes that the earth was falt, and that there is a large ice ring around it. so your ps who believe lies can say that the earth is round, but you only can really know it when you have stepped into a balon. just like our dear . a... , a name that should never be forgotten♥  	35	2

It's not my fault your stupid and do what your told. At least we know you'll always be a laborer that much is confirmed. So next time try to find another way to make a ass of your self.

Lol being foreal  unlike you most my friends are scientist so I dont have to lie. Get more info before you talk shit. All my friends graduated. And one's a rocket scientist, the other is in robotics, another in astrophysics, and astronomy. I have friends how are therapist  your opinion means nothing to me. I'm text you from my boys helicopter flying over NYC right now. And we discussing this and he went to college like me. And sorry what your saying is what the mass believes. There no answer with that.

2018-09-30 14:07:04	Androva J.	@ what does hiding our planet's geometric structure have any point in anyways? What do elites gain from this and why would the world's governments unite to firm a gigantic conspiracy theory. If people were to find out the world is flat, so what? Would it change anything? No.  	35	2
2018-09-30 13:59:26	Freddie Dixon	@ so are we kool Because you guys have no answers, your just trolling me. Hoping to get under my skin, but intelligently speaking why waste time. So when you guys are ready answer the questions, otherwise you all sound stupid, why again I posts logic, you post your opinion.  	38	5
2018-09-30 13:57:06	Freddie Dixon	@ yawn not my fault y'all stupid information right I front of you. But your scared. You hold on to the ball theory like its religion. Again you guys answered none of my legit logical questions. You done nothing but  fun. But again I'm obviously smarter, I believe by choice, you have to be told who, what, where, why and how, if any to believe, so again I'm not offended I'm laughing because I know the truth, it's you who refuses knowing.  	38	5

2018-09-28 19:30:31	haha yes	 How do lunar eclipses work? Since they require the Earth to be between the sun and moon. Doesn’t work on your flat earth model, huh?  	35	2
2018-09-28 12:34:44	mel 1234	If the earth is flat becuz we were told lies from astronauts then my goodness we are ghosts becuz we can't believe these doctors either .... u never see your own heart they do so dont trust them just like flat earthers can't see the earth is round.. always must think someone is lying to them for fun.  	35	2
2018-09-28 10:58:57	Freddie Dixon	@ clearly when u read u will find your answer I owe you nothing. So when you answer the 14 questions I asked I'll answer your silly question until then troll  	38	5
2018-09-28 04:23:23	silentunion	 Okay. Clearly you're a troll if that's your reply. I can't take you seriously at all if you just respond with just sticks and stones instead of anything even remotely smart. Oh noes I'm sooooo scared. lol I win this conversation on the interwebz, Goodbye  	38	5

2018-09-27 22:58:43	Freddie Dixon	@ are mad sorry you've been lied too. But get over it.  	38	5
2018-09-27 22:55:10	Freddie Dixon	@ yawn I'm waiting brother  	10	5
2018-09-27 22:00:07	silentunion	 Where's your proof? "Common sense" is not proof. However, if you want to know why the moon in larger, stand farther away from your computer. Notice is getting smaller? Now place a pen directly in front of you and notice that there's a point where the pen and the computer is the same size! What do you have to counteract this? And don't give me "it's just common sense" like some baffoon who clearly want to talk but not use his brain.  	37	2
2018-09-27 19:26:57	Freddie Dixon	@ enjoy your lie, I rather be informed peace dumbass brother and good luck again in you dumbass journey full of followers, I know your a leader.

2018-09-27 16:43:04	Freddie Dixon	@ once you realize there is no answer your ready for the truth. This is becoming fun,  	38	5
2018-09-27 16:42:17	Freddie Dixon	@ ok Darth try again  	8	5
2018-09-27 16:39:36	Freddie Dixon	@ again what is it  	25	5
2018-09-27 16:39:23	Freddie Dixon	@ and a friend of mine is a astrophysicist  	35	5
2018-09-27 16:38:55	Freddie Dixon	@ so now where playing starwars what's the force  	22	5
2018-09-27 15:02:14	Chilli Vanilli	wow.. try hards trolls explaning this dumb earth is flat theory. Like seriously this is getting old and nothing intelligent comes out of you trying to prove that earth is flat aka being that kind of a troll. It's funny how they say "you can't prove it's round so I win" while they can't prove that it isn't without being a troll. One of the most stupid argument I heard is "if the earth was round why are the maps flat HUH?" this start to feel more like the flat earthers are battling of who has less IQ. I mean fine flat earthers if that's what it's about you win👏👏 ☀🌎🌒  	35	2
2018-09-27 14:57:35	The ELEMENTAL DRAGENKI	@ gravity is force .what? u want me to show you a picture of force? Literally impossible  	35	5
2018-09-27 14:21:57	Freddie Dixon	@ no you didn't you explained what it does. Again what is it. Stop telling me buoyancy and density look up the s you will see your wrong. You do have a dictionary don't you  	33	3
2018-09-27 12:21:50	The ELEMENTAL DRAGENKI	@ not only did I tell you what gravity is but also provided u with what it does youre just bias lmao  	35	5
2018-09-27 12:18:41	The ELEMENTAL DRAGENKI	@ gravity, basic PHYSICS the force that attracts a body toward the center of the earth, or toward any other physical body having mass. For most purposes Newton's laws of gravity apply, with minor modifications to take the general theory of relativity into account.  	35	2
2018-09-27 11:40:04	The ELEMENTAL DRAGENKI	@ you can search it up I don't need to explain  	37	5
2018-09-27 11:39:19	The ELEMENTAL DRAGENKI	@ if anyone is a troll it's you stop that buddy  	38	5
2018-09-27 11:27:32	Freddie Dixon	@ again provide proof not  of mouth actual prove, and since you can't sorry I don't believe your theories I think you like the mass are full of shit  	37	5
2018-09-27 11:25:03	Freddie Dixon	@ see you dont read I asked this question that's not a answer I'll wait  	38	5
2018-09-27 11:24:31	Freddie Dixon	@ again what is gravity dont tell me what it does, what is it  	35	5
2018-09-27 11:24:01	Freddie Dixon	@ no where not do the experiment troll at this point your a troll you have no proof just want your 15 mins of fame huh . In the end your still ignorant and anyone who graduated can see that in how you construct yourself as well as your comments. A battle of wit sorry  your unarmed  	19	5
2018-09-27 11:21:43	The ELEMENTAL DRAGENKI	@ can't if I'm talking to a child  	7	5
2018-09-27 11:19:40	The ELEMENTAL DRAGENKI	@ when we are spinning we cant feel it because the planet is um idk hundreds of thousands of miles wide? We don't fly off because of gravity that pulls us down I wonder if u even payed attention in school. 😂😂😂🤣 gravity pulls everything towards the planet and or holds it in place how can you explain what it does and not know what I is? You sound dumb as shit cause were explaining what gravity is. At night time it is dark the reason the moon is able to shine is because sunlight from the sun bounces off the moon an gives the glowing appearance. That's why you don't see it that well in the morning as it fades to the other side  	35	2
2018-09-27 11:16:36	Freddie Dixon	@ that was smart now try talking like a man genius  	38	5
2018-09-27 11:06:23	The ELEMENTAL DRAGENKI	@ youre retarted  	25	7
2018-09-27 03:11:10	Freddie Dixon	@ so you have your evidence I'll wait for your answer. And the answers to the questions from earlier  	37	5
2018-09-27 03:09:52	Freddie Dixon	@ and I say that because even if I showed you, you would never believe the truth, that's why I'm a individual, not part of the mass. I live in this world, my heart and soul plus mind is with the father. So calling you names was outtake line but we're all human. Plus do you hear yourself when you repeat what they say, for someone like me of clear mind your the kray one not punt intended  	38	5
2018-09-27 03:04:33	Freddie Dixon	@ I receive no victory from telling the truth. None at all pride cometh before the fall. I more or less can't understand why and  you didn't answer any of my questions lol but I understand because, there is no answer that's why I stated it in the first place. Think young  knowledge is earned not provided, plus that's not life. Life as well knowledge of truth can't be contained. I speak as a person who read as many or more books then you. I haven't seen tv since 2001 and radio 2002. I believe repetition is brainwashing, thugs, and rock and roll ring a bell. Brother it's in everything, it's all fake lol but our father is not. Well you fell down the rabbit hole. Lol I'm just the Cheshire cat. And  if you noticed, but like all I'm not all there  Haha and the moorerats  	7	5
2018-09-27 02:58:03	Freddie Dixon	@ and I'll answer questions  	25	7
2018-09-27 02:55:39	Freddie Dixon	@ the book of enoch read  his name is not God lies we're created to confuse you I know it crazy. But yes the king  version is a lie. When u pray to the "lord" you pray to lord baal. When you pray to God you pray to gadreel aka the bearer of light, the fallen one.  this  is a lie but our father is not. The lies we're put in place to keep you lost from the truth. You call it myths I give you that because the truth first our father was hidden from us. Can you see open your eyes, your common sense and you will see rather then be told what to think, and have to feel, how to enjoy life. Only though our father is life complete, but there a long road ahead putting down the lies that we're force feed to us since birth. It's time brother to question everything. And ok if the bible does not get what u need use the knowledge they have you.  in plain sight. I can't tell you but quantum physics another book you need to read. The world is the computer, we're the walking dead. With out the father you can't get out of here. And you doom to stay in this hellhole forever. So believing in people never again.  I can't show you anything, buy like the guy in the movie I showed you the door. It's up to you to walk though.  	35	5
2018-09-27 02:19:58	Insane Mang	@ oh you mean the mind thats calling you out on your bullshit that has thus far provided no evidence to your arguments as well. Im not giving answers to questions i can't properly answer since im not knowledgeable in said subject that you think you are so full of wisdom on from just reading facebook posts and watching radical youtube videos. I will not sink to your level of idiocy. So i may not be able to answer some of your questions but atleast im not concieted enough to say i win an argument with half assed questions that you thought were a personal victory for your ever so small band of lunatics.  	38	5
2018-09-27 02:00:17	Insane Mang	@ and once again you contradict yourself by calling what you say fact when you haven't even given any real evidence to what you say isnt 100% true according to your earlier statement.  	37	5
2018-09-27 01:21:28	Freddie Dixon	@ Exactly so where done here I can't talk to brainwashed people who have no mind. Enjoy your program  	37	5
2018-09-27 01:12:51	Insane Mang	@ oh my god you're using a book of myths and legends that cant be proven, and a rainbow is the refraction of light through the condensed moisture in the air.  	37	2
2018-09-27 01:08:33	Freddie Dixon	@ and I won't care if you believe me. Believe what u want I give you fact not opinions.  	19	5
2018-09-27 01:03:29	Freddie Dixon	@ with out evidence you sound stupid shall I go on  	37	5
2018-09-27 01:03:03	Freddie Dixon	@ and wig ever said it was flat, it's not round. And going by rainbows with need reflection I say well yea its flat and we're in a dome, as the bible says nothing comes in, and nothing goes out, and again your evidence I'll wait  	35	2
2018-09-27 01:00:44	Freddie Dixon	@ watch the interview I'm done with u  	38	5
2018-09-27 00:45:05	Insane Mang	@ in the s of buzz light Year "you are a sad strange little man, but you have my pity" and there is no point in explaining something to someone who doesnt intend to look at both spectrums and for the record ive never seen a flat earth picture so until you can produce one of those yourself i wont believe you.  	35	2
2018-09-26 23:26:56	Joe Ligmama	5000 dislikes are exactly from them  	4	5
2018-09-26 20:15:24	Freddie Dixon	Question how come there no proof on earth to prove your claims global ing is a lie there no proof anywhere to prove your theory and as in real science you experiment and if the experiment is wrong then your answer is wrong also, did you know that the study of science itself does not prove truth only thing to be 100 percent false. So scientists do not provide truth just theories. Now that I proved you don't have a mind of your own my question again why or how can you believe anything when u have no proof and done no experiments of your own. So I proved you wrong next dumbass  	20	2
2018-09-26 17:39:28	Freddie Dixon	@ now talk shit. That's real talk I'll wait for a real answer not a spewd answer from followers, but I will wait to see what more lies you got for me  	38	5
2018-09-26 17:36:23	Freddie Dixon	@ yep I'm over your head. Enjoy the spinning ball question if we spin how come you can't feel it. Questions 2. Why don't we fly off. Question 3. What is gravity how come you guys can explain what it does but you don't know what it is. Question 4 if the moon reflects sun why when then sun is down the moon shines. Question 4. Why can't any of you produce a real picture of earth. Not photo shop. Question if your so smart how come NASA already admitted that they photo shot. Question 5 so you question nothing. Question 6. Why haven't u produced a real answer, besides fight with me with no answers just opinions. So when you guy are ready I'm here. Space is a lie so is  travel. Here something to help you think, rocket do not, I repeat do not work with out air, how do we go to . Another question. If we went why the ass liars excuse me astronauts take one pic of earth. And last but not least. Why did buzz Aldrin already admit we never went to the moon. Now I'll wait  	35	2
2018-09-26 17:27:54	Insane Mang	@ i think that tinfoil hat is a bit tight on your head man its cutting off the bloodflow to your head.  	19	5
2018-09-26 17:23:59	Freddie Dixon	@ no that's perception learn before u talk  	19	5
2018-09-26 16:23:53	Insane Mang	@ dude really. The sun looks the same size because its far enough away that it appears the same. Its like if you have a golfball and a bowling ball hanging from the ceiling move the bowling ball back enough and it will appear the same size. Basicly an illusion  	35	2

2018-09-26 06:17:40	Alexander Hyde	@ Oh jeez. A flat Earther. I like to say each to their own but you are SO misguided. The Earth Isn't flat for the reasons these people have been hawking at you for. Timezones, Eclipses, gravity, day and night. I could go on for a million years but I believe I have made my point. And BTW I'm in my final year of studying for my Astrophysics PhD in CAMBRIDGE so.  	35	2
2018-09-25 23:55:27	Freddie Dixon	@ for I rather be wrong and have no knowledge at all, then to uptain knowledge that's tainted, and not understand why I follow in the first place. It's called being free. But good luck  	7	5
2018-09-25 23:53:41	Freddie Dixon	@ smh read I'm not your teach learn it helps  	38	5

2018-09-25 20:43:18	Yooshi Yooshi	@ I would ask where you went to school but you'd just deflect the question by asking where I went because flat earthers have a skull as dense as the knowledge the internet has provided them.  	35	2
2018-09-25 17:04:08	Carlos Spicy-Wiener	 you calling me ignorant is kind of ironic, i actually try to give you a sound piece of advice. And you try and insult me. And btw the it's funny that you say I can't read, because your writing is like a third grader.  	7	5
2018-09-25 16:41:44	Freddie Dixon	@ Spicy-Wiener so read u might learn dumbass good luck on your I believe what I'm told journey again why do I care what u think you beneath me  	38	5
2018-09-25 16:39:09	Freddie Dixon	@ Spicy-Wiener your ignorance is all over the people don't fault me cause you can't read anyway  	38	5
2018-09-25 14:35:25	Carlos Spicy-Wiener	 my ignorance? It's the mindset of flat earth ears, that everything is a lie and every little part of proof you show them is fake or photoshopped, which is Ignorant. Ever heard of the saying "you only hear what you want to hear"? If so then please just try to hear what people are saying and don't listen to everything with the mind set of "I am right and everybody is wrong" maybe then you'll begin to understand and reason with logic.  	35	2
2018-09-25 14:19:34	Freddie Dixon	@ Spicy-Wiener that has nothing to do with your ignorance  	38	5
2018-09-25 11:49:10	Carlos Spicy-Wiener	 your sentence is all over the place...  	8	5

I know it's fun to feel like  Bauer thinking everything is a conspiracy but you guys really don't realise how stupid you make yourselves looks. We laughed at you people but now it's kinda freaky how some people stand by this stuff.  	35	2
2018-09-25 05:14:16	Carlos Spicy-Wiener	 hello? I actually am talking to you, i guess all that flat earth bullshit has corrupted your brain so much that it's not working right.  	35	2
2018-09-24 21:24:34	Freddie Dixon	@ density and buoyancy look it up smart ass, then feel stupid when u discover I'm right, shit for brain, read it helps I'm not your teacher  	33	3

2018-09-23 16:26:25	Freddie Dixon	@ it will explain the rest then like many including  you realize you've been lied to, and yes I felt stupid, I felt like a robot. Brainwashed but you have to read. Knowledge is uptained not given, I apologize I shouldn't call names but real and you will see what individuals not the mass sees until then we're on a different plain  	19	2

2018-09-23 16:16:58	AH Gaming	@ Alright, not once have I called you names, so be mindful of what you're saying. I don't think God is going to reject me because I "dont" know the shape of the earth. I have read the scriptures you are talking about. I would like you to explain to me how lunar eclipse can occur on a flat earth.  	35	2

2018-09-23 11:17:07	Freddie Dixon	@ again read in your bible it says it's flat so your not a tian your a new age thinker, it's in the bible earth is in a enfragment nothing leaves nothing goes out so read first then come back now you sound stupid just throwing opinions  	35	2
2018-09-23 11:05:53	Deepak Kumar Shaw	@ If earth is flat then can you explain how day and night occurs?  	35	2
2018-09-23 01:27:33	Espakuz •	@ I want to see a picture of the ice wall oh and also almost every flat earther I came across are ignorant no matter what we do you will just day no with no more arguments the sun looks that same size like the moon bcuz the sun is so far away if you are farther away it seems smaller a real picture of earth was taken from the moon it's called the "blue marble" search up on Google  	35	2
2018-09-23 00:02:10	Freddie Dixon	@ show one picture of earth just one, and I'll believe it's round  	35	2
2018-09-23 00:01:35	Freddie Dixon	@ and yes I do again prove it  	25	5
2018-09-23 00:01:05	Freddie Dixon	It explains everything  	10	7
2018-09-23 00:00:33	Freddie Dixon	@ then I'm a follower of christ read your bible  	37	9
2018-09-22 23:29:01	AH Gaming	@ First off, you have no proof its CGI. You are just too close minded to think the earth is possibly round. And I'm only a follower of t.  	35	2
2018-09-22 23:13:01	Freddie Dixon	@ chi is not proof again prove proof or your a follower  	37	5
2018-09-22 22:31:45	AH Gaming	Did you watch the video? How is that not enough visual proof.  	37	5
2018-09-22 22:09:21	Freddie Dixon	@ ruh real proof otherwise I believe it's a lie  	8	5
2018-09-22 21:32:16	AH Gaming	Click the link I provided you, it clearly shows the earth on camera. I know... "NASA has all CGI photos of earth, every one of them is different" I know your argument, it is sketchy, I can agree. Watch the video I provided you and there will be nothing you can say about it. If you dont like clicking links, then type in: Astronauts TROLLING flat-earthers by VLNOW.  	35	2
2018-09-22 20:39:54	Freddie Dixon	@ with all due respect produce one picture of earth no chi and I'll believe you otherwise I think where done  	35	2
2018-09-22 19:45:02	AH Gaming	@ With all do respect, I used to consider  a "flat earther". And probably know more about the flat earth movement than you. I have carried out extensive research into the "flat earth" theory. At first I was hooked, but the more research I fulfilled, the more counter evidence I discovered. I suggest you check out the video I recommended to you. That video is most likely undeniable proof of the earth being round.  	35	2
2018-09-22 19:33:49	Freddie Dixon	@ rockets can't work without air so how we go to   	35	1
2018-09-22 19:33:14	Freddie Dixon	@ I my self like you followed others till I experimented  the earth doesn't move. In fact I have some friends two friends aviation and rocket science and truth it's a fraudulent sorry u believe in a lie  	35	2

2018-09-22 19:28:48	AH Gaming	@ Watch this video,  maybe it will change your mind. Its actual video of earth from . Or you can be close minded and just instantly call it "CGI". Btw, it isnt a "fish eye" lense.  	35	2
2018-09-22 19:24:45	Assootosh Motah	@ hmmm, a flat surface without edge, interesting knowledge, please explain to me that illumination man, I am just dumbass who has gone to school for 12 years😄  	35	5
2018-09-22 19:21:03	AH Gaming	@ "if that was true the why is the moon the same size", because the sun is 93 million miles farther from earth than the moon.  	35	2
2018-09-22 17:37:53	Chilli Vanilli	of course there will be  flat earthers.. just embarrassing  	35	2
2018-09-22 17:15:56	Swirvin' Birds	@ no we dislike you exactly because you are using your brain and it keeps comming up short of reality.  	38	5
2018-09-22 12:32:39	Freddie Dixon	@ I'll be waiting forever because I know you'll spew the lies they told u. Sorry dont repeat they're lies you sound dumb  	38	5
2018-09-22 12:31:10	Freddie Dixon	@ really prove proof I'm waiting  	37	5
2018-09-22 06:33:58	Ilias Boutchichi	@ There is proof right in front of us that the earth is a sphere.  	35	2

2018-09-22 00:57:47	i keep screaming but god won't answer	I'm referring to , not you. You've got a good taste in humor.  	8	5
2018-09-22 00:55:53	Sastrvga	whatever dude  	25	7
2018-09-21 21:37:10	Freddie Dixon	@ so try to find another way to be a dick that's if you have the education enough  	38	5
2018-09-21 21:36:30	Freddie Dixon	@ and try another way to argue when you battle intellectual minds, cause literally I'm laughing at how dumb you really are.  	38	5
2018-09-21 21:34:41	Freddie Dixon	@ and a ship sailing it a visual perception that's has nothing to do with earth being round, more of a optical illusion so try again bad example  	35	2
2018-09-21 21:32:47	Freddie Dixon	@ you've proved nothing go out side study you that thing u hate to do. The proof is right in front of you, to bad your to stupid to see it, enjoy your handball, I mean round earth because it's been proven over 300 years ago, so why they teach y'all this lie I don't know maybe to control your thoughts, your more predictable that way. But study  there no proof its round but there is proof it's flat. Ok how about this you find one real picture of earth, just one not chi gics, a real picture and I'll believe u  	35	2
2018-09-21 21:27:15	Freddie Dixon	@ and no prove anything how ever if you, your self record the stars you will see we don't move. And commonsense the sun is not 93 million miles away if that was true the why is the moon the same size  	35	2
2018-09-21 21:20:41	Sastrvga	If there's no edge, then what is there??? There are many experiments that prove the earth's spherical body. A ship sailing away from a laser to find the expected result. The further away it mover from the laser the higher it gets on the target area PROVING it is round and not a flat paste of rock on a giant turtle's shell dude  	35	2
2018-09-21 19:19:25	Freddie Dixon	@ no such thing as  prove proof otherwise chi isn't impressive  	19	5

2018-09-21 16:57:38	Freddie Dixon	There is no edge dumbass now don't u feel smart and yes it's flat, sorry I don't believe in the lie we were told. But don't hate me cause I use my brain and you rather be told who, what, where, why and how.... to believe, common statements from mist who didn't even graduate. Cause if you did you know nothing comes in and nothing goes out. They lie to control and your so brainwashed you'll probably fight me on this even though common sense proof though experiments that it is flat and we don't move. And gravity is a made up theory. But you keep think it's a spinning ball and swings around, the rotates around the sun and the universe. Nah dropping something on provides proof of buoyancy and density you know that if you graduated so who the dumbass now.  	35	2

2018-09-01 16:12:58	Mitsubishi F-2	The interesting thing about this is I'm fairly certain the waters encroachment would be far more substantial than this because this is only showing where the water would go based on elevation but as it rose it would begin eroding land and chances are spread into the Sahara and other parts of the world that don't get visualised here.  	5	3
2018-11-03 22:32:09	noctusowl	@ In time it would be even worse for low lands. In a few thousand years continental plates in the Antarctica and  that have been pressed down by glaciers would come up again pushing even more water to invade elsewhere.  	5	6
2018-10-09 07:24:11	Michael Brady	Noticed that the Pacific Islands and Bangladesh, supposedly the most prone countries, were totally ignored. What about the trade off in terms of more water in the atmosphere, lakes, rivers and stored as groundwater. Alarmist BS.  	31	3

2018-09-01 02:29:09	Marco Roberts	We have two ways to counteract this. A.) Actually start caring about our environment and increase spending on environmental friendly energy sources.      OR B.) and this is gonna sound stupid but> If it really starts becoming a gigantic problem, lets just take a gigantic amount of water out of the sea... and dig up a gigantic deep, huge hole or holes in the desert regions of the world and make man-made lakes. And pump more salt into the water to balance the remaining fresh water out. -again.... this is kinda dumb but it hypothetically can prevent world destruction.  	11	3

2018-08-28 06:13:26	Never 2bknown	Warmer climate disperses more water into terrestrial crevices, builds glacial caps and causes increases in glacial drift and large scale shearing while at the same time reducing ice flows through breaking and melting. It also causes air current shifts, increases monsoon and atmospheric saturation and cloud density. The entire science seems to be full of unqualified experts. Even so, Its about to get to the interesting after effects. Man doesn't make anything of consequence, he just makes consequences!  	31	2

2018-08-14 18:42:24	In Harmony With Earth	If the Earth's ice melted all sea level would drop. Most ice is floating in oceans and frozen water expands. Droughts are causing ice to melt and temperature to heat. If it rained like it should the glaciers would grow from the snowfall there would be more expansion from sea ice and sea level will rise. The weather is manipulated by aircraft pollutants deliberately to keep you dependant and controlled.  	5	6
2018-08-26 16:36:50	Rolf Jander	No, most of the ice is sitting on land like on , Antarctica and mountain glaciers. If the sea ice is gone earth will  faster and the land ice will melt faster.  	5	6

2018-08-09 19:50:00	AlienZoo1	If the ice was sitting on the water with water underneath going down 6 to ten miles deep of ice, then when it melts you will lose water out of the ocean by about 2 miles down NO water. Put ice in a cup fill then top with water just before full, now watch how the weight of the ice pushing down the surface by weight, you will see the ice holds water higher. When it melts you will see the water go down from glass. The weight holds the water down, so ocean will recede by one or two miles. That's how they walked that earth when it had no water, the ice must have froze again and that's why tre all underwater. Some buildings are 4 or 5 miles deep so that must have been dry. I say the inland of  was a big dam, and like that all over the world it was like that with large areas on land that held water like a dam. Someone must have destroyed the mountains or walls holding the water in those places. Adelaide looks like a place where the water was released back into the sea. You have to have ice freeze more to increase height of water on land. Water never disappears it just changes form, there is no gain or loss, earth has always had the same volume of water.  	31	6

2018-07-27 11:35:11	Greg Burgin	The IPCC was at the center of that email dump a few years back where they were "hiding the decline" that happened after 1997. It's all bullsh_t because the temp numbers from decades ago were mysteriously adjusted downward to make a ing trend look alarming. All of the run-away ing is in their adjustments. These nuts rant about  being the problem with it's CO2 emission when the USA has LEAD all the other industrialized nations in reduction of CO2 emissions. You know it's political re-distributionist bullsh_t when the activists reject the only reasonable way to drastically cut CO2 which is to build lots of nuclear power plants. And then you have the Paris Climate Accord which would have allowed the biggest offenders (China, India) to INCREASE their CO2 for another 10 years. But wait! I thought this was supposed be a big emergency with only 10 years to stop it???  but economic marxist-redistributionist BULLSH_T.  	20	2
2018-08-26 16:44:48	Rolf Jander	Freddy The decline was to do with an anomaly in tree ring data that scientists where trying to figure out not a reduction in global temperature after a massive El Nino event. They where not expecting their emails to be stolen so did not have to spell that out for you to understand. It is a classic case of quote mining. Temperature data has to be homogenized so that tre not comparing apples to oranges. For example sea surface readings used to be taken by putting a thermometer in a bucket of seawater, then from ship engine cooling intakes. Those readings are a touch er so they have to adjust for that. The funny thing is these adjustments actually lowered the temperature rise yet you guys cry the opposite.  	20	2

2018-07-25 17:25:15	Eduardo Hernandez	Someone smarter than me can answer this. When you put ice in a cup of water it fills it up by displacement. When the ice melts it doesn't suddenly overflow.  	33	6
2018-07-25 17:07:45	matej steinhauser	we have only way, to stop rising water. as well as slow destructing forest people. they will have to do the same with glaciers, destroy them with bombs, and drink it. disappearing glaciers for 14 billions of people will be good water for overpopulation. what's even better, that destruction of glaciers same what people doing to rainforests, can save large part of continents. if we don't do that, melting glacier will destroy amazon rainforest and another parts of lands. so when you overpopulated, destruct the glacier before it melted and create new fresh water for 14 of billion of people.  	31	6
2018-07-25 15:51:32	Bill Russell	This was a very nice video. What was not shown was how after the ice that cools the atmosphere melts to a liquid state it will continue to transition into vapor in the form of cloud cover as a response to the heating of the oceans to cool the planet back down. So the water will be spread over land and air.  	5	6

2018-07-17 17:01:43	rapid13	For all of you basic science failures who keep claiming that the melting ice won't raise the sea level because, "When I put ice cubes in a glass of water and they melted the glass didn't overflow,": just friggin stop. Please. You have no idea what you're talking about. But it's OK, I'm here to help and educate you. This is your homework:      Arctic sea ice floats on the ocean, and as more is added it spreads out. This is not like a glass of water where ice cubes are forced to be completely submerged. So, find the biggest bowl in your house, one with the widest opening and deep enough to handle a water depth of around 100cm. Fill it part way with water, so that the water depth is at least 50cm to the bottom, then add enough ice cubes to cover the water but not so many that any are forced underwater - remember, this is the ocean, ice isn't forced under, it spreads. Now measure the depth of the water to the nearest mm (to the top of the water, not the top of the ice). Allow the ice to melt completely. Measure the depth of the water in the same spot as before with the same measuring device. Report your findings here.  	31	6

Many others will be reading this in the future, and I am trying to get them interested in geological science. Besides, . Now that Kilauea(Kia Trend) has become dormant, I'm restlessly waiting for the next eruption. Maybe the next chapter will be the Mauna Loa(Loa Trend) taking up the slack, as Madam Pele continues adding land to the Big Island(Hawai'i).  	35	2

2018-09-21 21:14:33	John L	And thank you too Jasmine. Its nice to know that there are those out there, who are more than willing to share their knowledge base with others. I've learned so much more about geology this year, just by studying Hawai'i(Big Island) and the double trend hot spot there. I had a pretty good base, but I've been picking up so much since May of this year.  	35	2
2018-09-21 20:54:08	Evil Communist	The causes and proven and there are multiple solutions. The causes are manmade fossil fuels, the solution is renewable energy sources like solar, wind, hydro, and so on. The sooner we switch the sooner we can slow down Climate Change.  	20	2
2018-09-21 20:49:17	Jasmine Wood	@ you're speaking in vague generalities that make it very hard for others to comment on. Saying climate change is not up for debate doesn't really mean anything. What about climate change is not up for debate? If its not up for debate then how can we possibly understand it, or its causes? Without debate, understanding and education then how can ever be expected to do anything about it? Just like you im sure humans have a hand in climate change, as are most people( I think) and most scientists, but we have no real idea how much we're responsible for. So far we have no realistic way to combat it, there's some ideas, some seem promising but without further research and data we're unlikely to move forward in the best way possible. Just looking back at human history, we're wrong alot, probably wrong more often than we're right. Again, no dispute that its real, and honestly I think there's a pretty damn good chance we are responsible for a lot of climate change, it seems obvious, it also seems obvious that we know what we're doing that causes it... But say we are wrong, or possibly missing a big part if the equation... Then we make all the changes that seem necessary to "fix" the situation. That'll take a long time but pretend we flip a switch and implement 100%of those changes today ... But we're still missing a big piece of the puzzle, and climate change persists because we failed to understand it. In that scenario things will continue to be just as bad as they seem now, at best we give ourselves more time to solve the puzzle, at worst we actually make the problem worse or hasten the end result. The climate of earth is very dynamic and we're just beginning to understand that and the reasons why its so dynamic , most of us have no idea how fragile the balance is, I think I do, but I'm probably wrong. Of course we need to act now, any one with a brain can see what a mess we're making and that we need to get it together and stop asap, I can't see any harm in that and I certainly like the idea of it, but we still need to keep pushing forward with our understanding of all these things. There's any number of factors, known and likely unknown, certain not understood or misunderstood that affect our climate . Closing the case on climate change is a dead end and there's no more benefit to that than there is to continuing on the same path we're on now... In fact they go hand in hand and are both rooted in ignorance.  	20	2
2018-09-21 20:02:35	Evil Communist	Although you are right that Science changes. That doesn't mean Climate Change is still up for debate, when the majority of scientists say it is real it is NOT up for debate and we have very little time before the effects last forever.  	20	2
2018-09-21 19:56:45	Jasmine Wood	@ even tho I agree with basically everything you said... I'm not sure can make those claims and state that they're facts. Again, I generally think you're right, and there's plenty of evidence that points towards all of it being true, but its a massive equation and we don't have all the info, we nay never have all the info so its pretty hard to just state its a fact and part of science ... Science changes with new data. I still think we have enough data to know that we need to make some serious changes and should make them as fast as possible but its possibly just as dangerous to think that we know it all, and call it case closed ... Humans made climate change end of story ...etc. That wouldn't allow for further research and understanding which may in fact be necessary  	20	2

2018-09-21 19:07:27	Evil Communist	Global Warming isn't real, Climate Change is REAL. And, you can't disagree with it, since it is a FACT and is part of SCIENCE. Sadly, many people have been affected by the US education system.  	20	2
2018-09-21 01:30:25	Jasmine Wood	@ its not your job to debate or convince people. You gave more than enough info and stayed composed in the face of typical YT stupidity. When people refuse to be open to new ideas and data that's right in front of them ... Then you're just wasting your time. Save the effort and put it towards something that's actually worth it, convincing people on YT is pretty low on the list of worth while use of time. That said, thanks for the links, I'm sure I'll enjoy them, and your points are indeed solid and informative.  	19	5

2018-09-17 13:22:52	András Ács	While the climate has been changing always, the *rate* of current change is *utterly* unprecedented, and the timeline is consistent with humans starting to dump CO2 and others in the atmosphere. Besides believing what the majority of scientists say (i'm no conspiracy theorist) I can feel and see the change year by year in my country: springs and autumns all but disappeared, the heat is unbearable and lasts much longer, there are unpredictable strong winds out of the blue which weren't seen before, etc etc etc. There is current evidence all around the world.

2018-09-11 13:16:05	Me Alexander	 - Dude, ice ages happen when the suns cool downs, not when the earth moves, that has a very little relation, the Sun is becoming colder(as it is natural for it) and the magnetic field is becoming less dense as an effect (this will let more light enter our atmosphere , but it will not  our planet enough).This is how pretty much all ice ages happen, it"s when the suns cool down  cooling-faster-than-anyone-suspected/  	31	6
2018-08-23 20:13:11	Gaming With Noah	The boiling point of water is 100°C, not anywhere near 80°C, but the temperature of the sidewalk doesn't even matter. If it's 102°F in August, then the temperature is normal, if not less than what it should be. Well, it depends on where you live. Where do you live? Do you live in Sweden or something?  	36	0
2018-08-08 15:48:03	Gaming With Noah	Umm... 39°C is only 102°F. And 80°C is only 176°F. It's only a mild discomfort. Just don't walk on the sidewalk! And it's not like it's unusual for this time of year because it's August! August is the hottest month of the year. Also, floods don't necessarily have to be caused by ice melting. They can also be caused by excessive rainfall, excessive snowmelt, storm surge from hurricanes, dam failure, ext.  	36	3
2018-08-08 13:27:22	John L	, this is how Grand Solar Minimums take place. Climate is screwed up all over the world. If you are able to see the unusual cold in Europe, especially Italy, the Balkans, and even North Africa, or  and the northern US, you would see climate confusion. The climate is going crazy, and if you go and watch that movie "Little Ice Age, Big Chill", it happened back then, and its about to go into full swing in the very near future. We are in the opening phase of another 'little ice age', i.e. Grand Solar Minimum. Further, we are beginning the downward slide into the next glaciation phase of this Pleistocene Ice Age we are living within. I'll say again, "We are in the middle of an Ice Age, and it has been going on for 2.58 million years. Grand Solar Minimum:  solar-minimum-and-cosmic-rays/ Little Ice Age, Big Chill:  The Next Grand Minimum:  What is a Grand Solar Minimum?:  Adapt 2030:  There is so much information out there, that if you root around, you will be swamped with knowledge.  	31	2

2018-07-16 20:57:37	John L	My fingers are getting tired. But just remember this: 1, There is no next ice age coming on. We're already in one, and have been for the last 2.58 mil years. Its a glaciation that is coming again. A glaciation is just a chapter within the book(ice age). 2, Plate tectonics is what makes the geological world slowly turn. What Is a Subduction Zone?:  . Hawaii hotspot:  . 3, Hawaiian Volcanism:  Gotta Go. Enjoy the information.  	31	2
2018-07-16 20:42:25	Gaming With Noah	I'm still not completely convinced, but you can believe it if you want, I guess.  	19	5
2018-07-16 20:39:50	John L	It has practically everything to do with it all. If you look at the Pacific, to the north are the Aleutian Islands, and very epth for  water to make it through the Bering Straight, in quantity. Consequently, all relies on having to go through the Indian Ocean, around the Cape and then north toward . This is called the Atlantic Conveyor. When the er water reaches the cold Arctic waters, heat is exchanged, and the cooler water sinks to the bottom, and then makes its slow way back to the Pacific. This takes over 200 years to complete. However, before the two s joined together, the er Pacific had a direct path to the north Atlantic. The Pacific is er than the Atlantic, due to underwater volcanic eruptions. That's why its called the Ring of Fire. Plate tectonics determines the position of the land masses. And Subduction Zones almost completely circle the Pacific.  . This is where the majority of volcanic activity occurs, with a few exceptions, Hawaii being one. All this underwater volcanic activity adds heat to the ocean, which either keeps the water , or is lost due to evaporation, where  clouds carry rain to the western US. Its a continual ongoing cycle, where  currents/atmosphere try to equalize the global temperature. This goes on and on, and as long as the continents are where tre, and orbital paths are working, it will keep going this way. I suggest you dive into the wonders of geology. Its a fascinating subject and plate tectonics is the key to all this. Then when you get the gist of that, you will be ready to study the Hawaiian chain and how Hawai'i(island) is growing like it is, without plate tectonics. What's going on is that it sits on a 'hotspot' where magma comes directly from the liquid mantle and is hotter than what comes from subduction zones. That's why Hawai'i's volcanoes are shield volcanoes, instead of composite volcanoes. What's going on on the Big Island is like drugs to a junkie, if you are into this stuff. If I had it all to do again, I would have majored in geology instead of anthropology. I love geology.  	31	2

2018-07-16 19:53:21	Gaming With Noah	What do the tectonic plates have anything to do with cooling down the Earth? Does the water system in Europe that keeps the Earth from freezing get destroyed by the s moving in?  	5	6
2018-07-16 19:46:52	John L	They don't. Plate tectonics is what has been driving this current ice age for all this time. And the slow process of the joining of the two s has determined all this. As things slowly joined together, the planet cooled down until a 'tipping point was reached'. When the land bridge was complete we were officially in a major ice age. Very little is going to change until there is another change in the earth's plates position.  	31	6
2018-07-16 19:17:57	Gaming With Noah	But how do ice ages just start all of a sudden? It's not a gradual thing?  	5	6
2018-07-16 19:15:29	John L	Bob, this planet has been in the middle of an ice age for over 2.58 million years, known as the Pleistocene. As a physical anthropologist, who specialized in 'Early Hominids', the Quaternary Period is my specialty:  . And no matter what the 'so called' Climate Change Geniuses may say, we are just in a current interglacial(holocene). We are about to slide into another 100,000 year glaciation,........Real Soon. Further, you only read my first sentence.  is that since the Istmus of Panama joined the two s together(2.58mil years ago)  Pacific has not been allowed into the Atlantic, leading to a cooler planet. The Atlantic is the only practical way  waters can reach polar regions. And until it does, this Pleistocene will continue to be with us.  reconstructions-500000-years-high2.gif  	31	2
2018-07-16 18:56:05	Gaming With Noah	Wrong. There won't be an ice age. Also, the ice in the north pole has been melting for millions of years. It's not going to all disappear any time soon like you said.  	5	6
2018-07-16 18:23:05	John L	You mean their idea of 'global ing' isn't real. Anyway, I agree with you. Climate goes up and down all the time. Unfortunately for all of us, we are about to enter one more Grand Solar Minimum(Little ice age) for the next fifty plus years. And add to this the next upcoming 'Glaciation' within this current ice age, by then we may be lucky enough to be  faring by then, it won't matter.  	20	2

Since the land mass has been floating on ground water since the beginning of time and the ice would not melt over night the land would adjust as any ice melted . I thought so called scientists would be a little smarter then this . When the glaciers came over the land the weight of them forced the land to sink in many places and as it melted the land came back up again . Start using your mind and quit following these numskulls.  	5	6
2018-07-08 09:52:14	Ray Watson	That's why we have scientists, to avoid numskulls like you. The upper part of the USA is still rising from the previous Ice Age, so it doesn't happen that fast. "If you're standing, or sitting, somewhere in Michigan, the ground beneath your feet is rising — or falling, depending on where you are — all the time. Little by little. Almost imperceptibly, but steadily. The surface of the Great Lakes region is still recovering from the aftereffects of the last Ice Age, "  great-lakes-ice-age/363316002/  	5	6

2018-09-21 19:09:24	paranoidrodent	Quebec City was built up on the cliffs overlooking the St. Lawrence River. Good parts of the city including the Old City are built on highlands since the city was intended to be defensible. You'd need a huge rise in sea levels to put most of it underwater. Some of its lower lying suburbs (much of the inner northern suburbs lie in a valley between the highlands the city is on and the mountains the outer suburbs are build in) along with the historic Old Port district might need to tread water. I'm not sure if it would end up becoming an island or a penninsula (depends on high high the land is to the west of the city).  I'd be more worried about Halifax and the other cities out in the Atlantic region along with BC's coastal cities like Vancouver. Montreal isn't much further above sea level at the lower points than Quebec City either so it's coastal bits would be at risk too. Ottawa and the Great Lakes areas are too high in altitude to be at much risk.  	31	3

The level will not   change because, all of the water that exists is already there no matter how big the cube   or size of glass.   Displacement is math & physics. Grow up people & learn when you have been   made a fool of & lost so much of your money to because of donations to s.  	33	6
2018-06-26 16:52:57	Benthruit !	Boy. . That all went rite over your head. Put a rock in the bottom of the glass 1st. Then try. No difference. There are only so many water molecules in the "water cycle". Please, please try to think. Remember also that "only fresh water turns to ice. It has never been or will be what you have come to believe. The Antarctic is a land mass but, %90 0f the ice is frozen sea. It is literally a frozen dessert. Wind blown dessert. 100 mph wind scours it clear. If it did thaw, it would be such a small amount to not notice. North Pole is not a land mass.  	5	6

Meteorologists can't predict the weather a week ahead with more than 50% accuracy, but "this is what is going to happen in 100 years if we don't all live in teepee's and give AL Gore our money.      Plus, who cares, we all just move back from the coast a 100 miles or so. What a tragedy. More beachfront property.

If it appears to be close to the ocean, you need to travel north until you see it rise from the surface of the ocean. If it’s to the side of the boat, your either going into the Gulf of Mexico, or your going to get swept up into the Atlantic.  	35	3

Will the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere increase, and if so, will it result in more intense and frequent rainfalls? If so, will flooding increase as well inland? It seems that may already be happening...  	30	3

2018-07-28 03:24:28	Marth667	The 1.5 temp increase doesn't really mean much for humans. As demonstrated people can turn on the air conditioner or drink more water and they wouldn't notice much of an increase. The problem of temperature increase hits insects and birds the most. Regarding insects there is one particularly important insect that is responsible for our food production of as high as 70%. That is, the bee of course. There are documented cases of bees only being able to survive at most 50 centigrade and only for short periods of time ~1 hour, at which point they succumb to the conditions and die. These conditions can vary between humidity, natural wind breaks and sunlight but overall a hot bee is not a working bee. As temperature increases continue into the forseeable future food production will become  and no doubt food shortages will become common place and from there pick your flavour of rioting when food isn't delivered. Currently there is a disturbing trend where numerous bee hive extinction is occurring all over the world that is thought to be a compounded effect of invasive species, pesticides, temperature increase and climate change.  	31	2

2018-06-14 15:22:43	JohnJ469	I do have to marvel at the complete stupidity of these types of projections. How about doing one on "How we could feed the world if the  was made of Cheese"?      The ice will not melt in any time frame that mankind can possibly worry about. The problem is temperature and ice doesn't melt if the temperature is below zero. The est ever recorded at the  Pole was minus 12 degrees C. The current temperature (15/06/2018) is Minus 45 degrees. So for the ice to melt today it would require a temperature increase of 46 degrees C.      The average Summer temp is Minus 28.2 degrees C and the average Winter temp is Minus 60 degrees C. And  with any sort of knowledge about climate is claiming a temp rise of that amount. Simply not going to happen.  	31	6
2018-06-17 15:57:24	JohnJ469	And what is the point of an "If" video that has zero chance of ever happening? Note that this is under a "Climate Change" header, so it's reasonable to assume that the purpose is nothing more than to spread lies and fear. The ice cannot melt, the "If" can never happen, so exactly why take the time to make a video like this and put it online with a blurb about SLR? "There is no science in the video", which makes it a rather odd video for a channel called "Science Insider" to do then, isn't it? As I said, it makes as much sense as doing a video about feeding the world if the  was made of cheese.  	20	6
2018-06-15 17:37:41	Silenced Games	You do realise this is an “IF” video? There is no science in the video, no political opinion in the video. All it shows is what happens IF all the ice melted, nothing more.  	5	6

And if you can't see that climate change has already started to be a problem then you are not as intelligent as you think you are. Are you apart of the group that thinks tre intelligent? If so, then amazing! It's quite obvious what happens when you mix cold and hot water, the temps change, those temp changes change the environmental factors that effect everything. Not to mention that Fukushima is STILL leaking radiation into the gulf, leading to even more issues with the one thing that keeps us all alive. If you really think it's going to be several generations then you are not paying close enough attention. Plus, the fact that you seem perfectly content with this disaster that approaches because you will be dead so who cares, shows exactly what's so fucked up with your brain.  	31	2

2018-12-19 10:44:30	MasterHutch Gaming	@ not a single president ever has given a shit about that. The president's are nothing more than a puppet, trump has mentioned the people that rule over him and things before. He doesn't do it so much anymore I think due to them letting him know if he said more they would likely JFK him. He has worked on stopping several aspects of the Kabal, people only see the game today but there is a 3D chess match going on and you have to look at all the moves, not just today, you have to see what has been done, like him raising his tarrifs actually caused China to finally come down on their tarrifs for the first time ever. I don't trust trump, he is a puppet but I have to say it sure seems he might have become more like Pinocchio where he is a puppet but only acts like the puppet so as to keep up the rise against without being assassinated. Think about how badly everyone rails on him for a few things he said,  straight up dewomanized a woman in the oval office by shoving his hotdog down her throat, and very few said anything bad about it, he even lied about it then later confessed and everyone was like eh just let him be him, trump makes some jokes and he becomes the worst thing since Hitler, though. Really? But yes we really really so have to keep a very close eye on the weather and what's going on. Florida is normally in the 70s this time of year and we are sitting in the 50s and 60s. The summers are hotter and the winter's are colder. Last time fluctuations in temps were seen like this the planet was going into an Ice Age, and tons of other shifts happened as well, like where the er zones were located and such. We have always been getting er since the last ice age, but as those temps rise, the ice melts lowering the temps of the waters which determine the temps we see, which is why the colds are getting colder. Sure the sun is beating when it's on is, it's when it's not heating at much that you should truly be looking at the temps and determining what they will be like. Also, IDK if you saw me mention it but check out the poles, the scientific research all say tre shifting and everyone takes that as swapping just like everyone takes this climate change to mean it's getting super hot,when if fact it's quite the opposite, the poles are shifting position slowly but surely. Check out the data collected so far from where tre to where they were and you will see that the north pole is getting closer to Russia and the south pole is getting closer to  .  	31	2

Things wipl be drastic before the equalize but they will eventually come to a fairly decent balance. Mexico maybe the new Antarctica for all we know.

2018-09-07 12:12:20	MasterHutch Gaming	@ oh well I never said that I don't stand for protecting the planet and preserving what we can while we can. I also stand with adapting to the changes that come nature brings them. Idk if you have ever noticed but the poles are shifting. The north and south pole are not swapping tre all together shifting. Something that has been happening for a long time and contributed to the changes of the temperatures and the areas that are effected by what temps. Check out bird migrations and things and you will see that they have been slightly altering more and more, as well as data on the actual position of the poles lat and longitude coords over the past 70 years. Long before we were even born the poles have been SHIFTING not swapping as everyone seems to think will happen. North will become more east and east will become south. Not north becomes south and south becomes north. You should really look into that and then start checking the gradiant of the sunrise and sunset along the horizon. In Florida I see a huge difference from when I was younger to now in the position along the east west axis that it has been changing due to the shifting of the planets "equator" due to rotations being altered by the poles dragging themselves further and further  	31	2
2018-09-06 23:36:09	Tiger Lilly	@ Ok so you have a few valid points. But i still support the efforts of protecting the planet. Every body can do something. I just dont believe people should pass through here without a care and pollute the place up. And i dont stay on here is why i didn't reply right back bud😋😋  	3	2
2018-09-06 18:52:36	MasterHutch Gaming	@ I take it you realised your reply made you look more dense than the ice ts before they started melting?  	33	6
2018-09-06 06:34:05	MasterHutch Gaming	 D  D do you know anything about that landmass beneath the ice t of Antarctica? Check yaself before ya wreck yaself. Go do some studying on it. Lmaoo! Antarctica is even extremely mountainous NOW without all the ice. There are several areas MUCH lower than Antartica that would fill with water so, I go back to my original statement, why does the person think the landmass woiild just disappear? Also, the planet has been in constant waxing and waning of temperatures for a very long time. Do you know what event follows the supposed global ing very shortly after more and more ice starts melting? The tempertures start dropping dramatically. The mass amounts of water become cooler due to: 1. More water. 2. The nearly frigid temps of the ice. You really need to educate yourself, kid.  	31	6
2018-09-06 04:49:58	Tiger Lilly	@ Because when all the earths ice melts the sea level will rise. Thats what the video is about. GLOBAL WARMING!!  	5	6
2018-09-02 21:34:39	Mentally Ill Dark Jeroid	This is what happens when the poles shift and the earth tilts to a new axis, the ice that has collected at the current poles will melt and gradually reform at the new poles. So Antarctica might be a nicer place to live if the poles shifted. I for one could use a giant inland sea in the Central Valley of California. It would likely help reduce the desert in ern California as rains might form off that inland sea. I don't see any negatives to this. People should buy up my "Impact" and "Dance of Death"  er novels on Amazon so I can afford to move out of the desert into a forested area instead of waiting for a pole shift or climate change or whatever to gain a forest where I live.  	31	6

2018-06-20 16:54:03	Muhammad Hazim Mohd Jamli	 You do realize that all those ice in antartica is sitting on top of a continent right? The reason why Antartica is colder than the north pole is bcoz all the heat the ice ts received from the sun is absorbed by the soil beneath it. While the Artic is on top of an ocean. Water. Which naturally have higher "c" than soil. Thus, absorbing the heat slower.  	5	6

2018-06-13 03:02:26	Deas Plant	Hi, Folks.   Total volume of Antarctic ice cap = approx. 27 million cubic kilometres.   Total volume of  ice cap = approx. 2.7 million cubic kilometres      Total volume of ALL ice cap on earth = approx. 29.7 million cubic kilometres      Total volume of all oceans on earth = approx. 1.335 BILLION cubic kilometres.      That is to say - 1,335 MILLION cubic kilometres.      Now I'll let you do the math on just how much ocean rise is going to occur IF 29.7 million cubic kilometres of ice melts into 1.335 BILLION cubic kilometres of ocean. For a start, 29.7 million is around 0.0222 of 1.335 BILLION. Just how far is adding another 2.22 100ths of the coean's total volume? Or 1.11 50ths? Over an area of around 360 MILLION square kilometres????????      Then stop and think about how much of BOTH ice caps is already IN the ocean in the form of ice shelfs.      Food for thought???????????????      Just my 0.02.      You all have a wonderful day. Best wishes. .  	31	6

You've got to remember, when ice melts that mass when it becomes water is less volume. Hence ice floats in water. Only ice on land melting will have some effect. And even then. . Just look at what it would take to raise the water level of the Pacific for example. So don't rush out and buy life jackets just yet guys.  	5	6

I mean if the ice in our glass melts the water level goes down but we are to believe that what we were taught in science class and what we observe in our daily lives is not true and that when ice melts it increases the sea level.

These new liquids are from human waste and foriegn liquids from manufacturers and garbage dumps  	33	3
2018-06-07 12:06:44	Willie McGraw	Horse-hockey at best!! Fill a glass with ice and then put in water to the top and see what happens when the ice melts! There is always someone trying to scare people with this fake- science and their take on what MIGHT happen. Ice is not predominately water, it is water and air, for without the COLD air the water would not be able to freeze in the first place: DUH!!!!  	33	6
2018-08-23 15:39:58	C G	 ’s ice is mostly on land so that would cause flooding and the ice is miles high so it will effect the sea level and some parts of Antarctica has land under the ice.  	5	6
2018-08-02 21:02:22	Anthony Mancini	Just for you science people out there, floating objects (including ice) displace their mass while sinking objects displace their volume. Ice that is floating in water will not affect water level after it melts but that does not account for ice that has built up on land or on ice that has stuck to land and has more ice built on it. When all of that melts, the water level will rise which is what we are seeing in our oceans.  	5	6
2018-07-17 18:43:08	Willie McGraw	I do appreciate you reading my comment and replying to it. We were taught in school that for every 10 inches of ice there is only one or so inches of melted water and after that it does spread over a much larger area than when it was frozen. I placed a cube of ice in a 4 or 5 inch bowl and watched as it melted and found that it's height was minimal though it's area was much larger and we can continue to make comparisons of what science has taught us. I still think as a whole the melting ice-caps will have effect on our shore lines and low-lying terrain there near-by. With the population at the height of what it is now it will cause many to evacuate many of the low- lying areas. thanks again for your reply!  	31	6
2018-07-17 16:49:46	rapid13	You also missed basic science. The ocean isn't a glass. Try this at home: fill a wide-brimmed bowl with water part way, add a few ice cubes (enough that they almost cover the water but not so many that any are forced underwater), then measure the depth of the water (the water, not the level of the ice). Now allow the ice to melt completely and measure the water depth again. Report back what you find out.  	33	6

2018-06-18 07:57:20	nilesable	Willie,your Horse-hockey scientific analogy only works if all the melting ice was in the floating,but it's not,much of it is on land and will flow into the oceans as it melts. So try this experiment instead,take glass and fill it with water. Put a rigid screen on top of the glass you filled (the screen represents land). Now put ice on the screen so it can melt and drip into the already filled glass. Then,once you realize the ice on the screen melted,turned to water and overflowed the glass look in the mirror and go DUH!!!!  	5	6

During that time, the increase in temps would have  a massive worldwide migration away from the tropics. No food would grow there and people could not survive. During this migration (hundreds of years at least) cities would be rebuilt or built further from the ocean and  has to die. As an added bonus this melting would actually increase farmable land by nearly 30% worldwide, so  has to starve anymore. Silver lining.  	5	6

2018-06-06 02:11:19	Jj Jj	The lowest points on earth (land) are mostly on very dry area's. Where the groundwater level keep going down. What if we start filling these piece of lands with desalnated water? It would not do inmidiatly effect the oceans level but when you calculate it will rise the groundwater level it will defnitly have some effect. China has technoligy to grow back plants in the desert. If the grounwater rise and you turn deserts back into places where plants will grow (that also would keep water) it will have a major effect. Also then i think there will be more rain falling in these dry area with sideffect of lower the temperature on these places. The solution and technoligy is there already. Question is...howlong are we gonna wait untill start doing it?  	30	3

2018-08-26 18:09:42	Luc Taylor	 exactly, outside forces causing a change in Climate.. carbon emissions were a role, but not the cause. the cause of current Climate Change is human-released CO2.  	20	2
2018-08-26 17:50:12	Rolf Jander	Check out the wiki page on the Permian event.  It was a complex event and what set it off is up for debate but co2 from burning coal and methane are believed to have played a major role in how it played out. Particularly worrying is the part about anoxia and Hydrogen sulfide emissions. Hydrogen sulfide emissions We could be heading for that again.  	20	2
2018-08-26 17:25:15	Luc Taylor	 ah good to know youve joined the server  	24	5
2018-08-26 17:18:26	Rolf Jander	Well for one thing some of the past changes in past climate, such as the Permian extinction where catastrophic for the life that was on earth at the time and it was largely caused by increasing co2 levels. Deniers would never say that.. Other changes like the cycles of glacial and er periods of the current ice age where survivable for most of the living things. Mammoths for example lived for at least 3 million years thru several glacial and inter glacial periods. The current change in temperature is happening rapidly and if it goes too far will pass tipping points that will change the state of the planet to what is called a hot house earth. No denier says that right? Luc, I am no climate science denier. I know we have virtually no time left to avert disaster and it does not look good, but we have to try to be accurate in what we say in our debates with the deniers so as not to give them any ammunition to use against us.  	20	2
2018-08-26 16:45:48	Luc Taylor	 Climate Change deniers believe that since the Climate changed numerous times in the past and survived, the current change of temperature is temporary and can be reversed. How is this different then what you believe?  	20	2
2018-08-26 16:43:22	Luc Taylor	 due to your incoherent ing I have no idea what your claim actually is. The Permian Period was cursed from the beginning. The rapid changes of the environment due to supercontinent Pangaea's growth and imbalance made it difficult for life to adapt quick enough. On top of this, it is suggested that several meteor impacts caused the climate to change abruptly. The Permian Extinction was caused by several unfortunate events, but none of them had to do with a natural climate change due to volcanoes or methane released from the Ocean Floor. It is possible that the Climate has changed multiple times before on Earth, but evidence shows that these changes were caused by outside forces, and that life was only able to survive because of a stable ecosystem. In the present, the Climate is heating up rapidly and the cause has already been identified: Human Impact. Humans have created an irreversible change to Earth's atmosphere and destroyed the Ecosystem and possibilites of redemption. You want me to do research right? Here are my sources: -  world/permian/ -  nasa/2002/28jan_extinction  	31	2
2018-08-26 16:15:27	Rolf Jander	 It had everything to do with co2. The giant magma eruptions themselves put out co2. They set massive coal deposits on fire that made more co2. There was an initial phase of nuclear winter as sunlight was blocked by ash. But then the co2 from burning coal caused a global ing that caused methane to be released from the ocean floor causing yet more ing. It happened so fast that most life could not adapt and died. The global ing we have just started to cause is happening far faster than that. This is not the same logic as the deniers. Climate changes for a reason. That reason can be natural as it was back than or it can be man made as it is now. What deniers do is called the forest fire fallacy. That goes that since climate changed naturally in the past humans can't change it is like saying that since forest fires occurred before people existed people can not start them now. One of the first building blocks of scientific understanding of the climate, was the discovery in the 1800's that the climate has been different in the past.  	20	2
2018-08-25 23:49:12	Luc Taylor	 youre using the same logic as climate change deniers.. plus, you know the permian extinction had nothing to do with CO2 right?  	20	2
2018-08-25 23:42:14	Rolf Jander	Do some research on climate of the earth thru the ages. Yes there have been dramatic changes before and many of them where really not good. The Permian extinction for example wiped out about 95% of life on earth. Changes in co2 levels played a large role in that one just like now. only now we are doing it. Civilization developed in an age of pretty stable climate however.  	20	2

2018-08-05 16:19:55	Rolf Jander	If it where not for our burning of fossil fuels and our agriculture, earth would already be very slowly cooling towards another glacial period in a few thousand years. Instead it is rapidly heating and causing a mass extinction event.  	31	6

2018-06-03 10:40:02	Nogent	you should have put the map of antartic because that's the point: if the ice of north pole melts completely, which will probably happen anyway , then it will cause many problems, but we might have a chance to deal with it, cause it's thick of only 3 meters (except bengladesh and few other places). But if the ice of south pole melts too, as it is 80 meters thicks, then the scenario on your map will happen...... and little chance humanity survives to this.....the only good point would be we could settle in antartica....  	5	6

2018-05-29 15:38:05	Johnn Smyth	Ya ya. If the ice melted. So what. The question which has the most impact is; What happens to all that Extra water at the Equator when the earth slows down or stops spinning? All of that Extra water, because of the centrifugal spin of the earth would then, after the 4-5 days of sloshing around level off everywhere around the globe. Most islands and island nations would no longer exist, coastal cities and towns would be under water and most people who, because they presently are too far inland to have to fear the effects of a hurricane would then be susceptible to Coastal flooding. Sure, ice melting is bad, but it’s all part of the Natural cycle of our planet and not caused by man. And people who say man IS responsible are paid shills of the farce known as Al Gore.  	31	6

2018-08-26 17:38:36	Rolf Jander	El Peruano "Most of the North Pole is almost gone, yet water levels are the same.." The  ice cap has barely started to melt. There is about seven meters of sea level rice in that one ice t alone.  	5	6
2018-08-26 17:35:31	Rolf Jander	Maurizo Pescatori "Not quite. Minor Ice Ages recur every 26000 years, and the last Ice Age ended ~10.000BC. This means we are now in the hottest period possible, which will last some 500 more years, before the planet starts cooling down again. The next Minor ice Age is scheduled to start in about 6500 years." Glacial cycles in the Quaternary ice age are more complicated than that. Tre governed by two cycles of earth's orbit and axial tilt. One cycle lasts 41000 years and the other about a 100,000. The est natural part of this  period was about 4500 years ago and the world was starting to cool before mankind started to inadvertantly  it up. With the current level of co2 in the air, and the fact that it is still rising. The next glacial period has been, at least for the foreseeable future, cancelled.  	31	2

Decreased solar flare cycles resulted in a lower amount of energy eminating from the sun by as much as 7% and resulted in cooling of the earth, a year without summer occurred, and European rivers remained frozen. The Thames even froze. It's a fascinating topic to review.  	20	2

2018-06-17 22:39:51	Just For Fun	 - Yes, this is what happened BEFORE modern man has had its effect on the planet. But how will the recurrence of Ice Ages evolve now that WE have affected global ing, at this point it's all quite speculative IMHO.  	5	6

2018-06-15 15:47:49	Maurizio Pescatori	Not quite. Minor Ice Ages recur every 26000 years, and the last Ice Age ended ~10.000BC. This means we are now in the hottest period possible, which will last some 500 more years, before the planet starts cooling down again. The next Minor ice Age is scheduled to start in about 6500 years.  	31	6

2018-05-23 03:21:46	jwboll	Excuse my skepticism. I'm old. Here's the problems I was going to die of when I was young...   Global cooling   Peak oil   Killer bees   End of the world (multiple times)   Ozone layer depletion   Economic downturn   Fiscal cliff   Dot com bubble   Armageddeon, (the meteor type)   Y2K bug. (apparently computers were going to nuke us all on the year 2000)   9/11   Global ing   Gulf coast oil spill   Climate change (because it started getting cooler)   Toyotas sticky gas pedal   Nearly having Hillary Clinton as the US president.  	20	2
2018-07-08 10:13:39	Ray Watson	Global cooling - was happening, until the CO2 started do its thing Peak oil - was real, lucky they figured out shale fracking, it saved the US economy. But now, have you noticed a rise in gas prices recently ? Killer bees - well, bees are dying out all over the world from herbicides, and the lack of pollination is going to wreck a lot of industries. End of the world (multiple times) - yeah, well - lots of religions nuts Ozone layer depletion - was serious problem, but slowed down with worldwide action on CNC's. Still not enough to prevent severe skin conditions in some parts of the world. In latitudes with 10 degrees from the Poles, increases in skin Cancer and Cataract blindness will increase over the next 40 years. Economic downturn - sorry, you WERE around in 2007 in the GFC, and millions lost all their super and savings, and the whole world is still recovering ? What a short memory. Fiscal cliff - getting taller. Extra 3 trillion of debt for the USA a few months ago, and now a trade war. It ain't going to end well. Dot com bubble - it happened. Millions lost their life savings and homes. , (the meteor type) - don't write that one off, Only last year a big meteorite came between the moon and earth. Y2K bug.- and it would have, except industry spent 4 trillion dollars to fix it, your taxes are still paying it off. It brought me a new car, thank you. 9/11 - that actually HAPPENED, followed by 3 billion dollars of your taxes fighting the middle east war, and nearly bankrupting the US. 60% of US couldn't handle a $500 emergency. Co-incidence ? Global ing - still happening. The droughts from Africa and   are driving all these refugees to Europe and the USA, which is what rump is having so much trouble with. Gulf coast oil spill - that happened. And it's still creating huge environmental issues for wildlife, and fisheries industry. Just Google a few things and check it out. Toyotas sticky gas pedal - if you haven't had that fixed by now, you need a new mechanic. Nearly having Hillary Clinton as the US president - rump is doing SUCH a good job, making enemies of  and half the civilised world, caging kids and starting off the trade war that's going to start your next depression. So, YOURE still alive, but managed to ignore the huge traumas of millions of people around the world. You must live in the USA where you just dont know whats really going on.  	20	2
2018-05-26 10:21:31	Ankan Halder	 Just plant a few trees, specially the types that grow big. Big trees absorb more carbon from atmosphere. Some US researchers are planning to clone and plant giant trees found in California. As you said you're old, your planted trees could live for hundreds or thousands of years, in other s- the effects of your 'bit' effort may live for hundreds or thousands of years. That's one way of thinking, right? Planting trees will prevent such theoretical catastrophe.  	3	2

Also lastly fireproof, earthquakeproof, 200 degrees proof! With a little window ! I would love for 7 things to happens in this order 1. The Yellowstone super volcano errupts covering the earth with ash for years... no  or humans outside! For at least the first 6 months! 2. Most of the ice melts and sea level increaaes, pushing 4 billion people out of their homes... about 30 in the us... europe its probably like 40 to 50... china is more like 60... 3. Countries go bonkers and bomb each other resulting in 15 percent of earth dead! The super volcano had already killed 25 percent already! So now we are at 40 dead... 4. Zombies come... i know its never going to happen blah blah blah! I just hope, then only 4. percent die only 4 percent because 95 to 99 percent of the world now have guns and they have practiced... 5. No more volcano ash, but still winter everywhere , now hurricanes all over the world! 6. Humans start to come together and they become friends after 12 percent dies because of friendliness or for food! 7. Only about 20 percent of the population is alive but 23 percent have ash in their lungs 17 have children, had children or are about to and no medicine so 75 percent of the woman die from birth leaving 30 percent woman and 70 percent men meaning most men will fight and kill for women and once men kill each other for sex tribes seperate to their agreeing people and they ... the 14 percent of the earths population lives on with 4 percent being women but all are athletes all elderly dies! All children are eaten or starved or die from weakness.... only pre teens through 40 yr olds ... strong and they could all run a marathon when starving for 5 hours straight ... and the humanity gets back up and millions of women increase! 60 percent of men are killed for raping... 60 percent of women are killed by their lovers for list, killing a child for food, or that other thing i cant say... but the point i dont like humans because why should anybody ? They take the anger out on everyone, they look for their food not yours, but plot twist you were the hypocrite you were thinking about that person getting you food instead of helping him with his or her food!.... so moral of story is who in the world stuck to ya to act and talk like that?

2018-05-21 21:22:32	Leafsdude	As a person who accepts that climate change is happening and it is a serious problem, videos like this that don't give the proper context (or "all you need to know", as claimed in the description) are highly disappointing. Yes, the video is very much accurate on what would happen in the situation described, it's just that **no** climatologist predicts that all land ice will melt in **any** reasonably short-term scale. Estimates are that, at most, sea levels will rise 8 inches (20cm) over the next 80 years. A serious and potentially highly damaging catastrophe, but less than 1/10th of the rise depicted in this video. At current rates, which are likely unsustainable, all land ice will melt no earlier than 2500, an absurdity not worth considering beyond a thought experiment or a hyperbolic statement, both of which should be explained when presented so as not to give an incorrect impression.      In short, I'm rather disappointed, .  	31	6
2018-05-21 19:57:58	RangerInParadise	What's a nice polite way of saying "this is absolute freaking bullshit"? Maybe they ought to make a rather bad movie with this scenario. Perhaps  Costner can star in it.      If all of the ice at the North Pole melted the level of sea water wouldn't rise at all. This came from "Science" Insider? LOLOL. Who runs that outfit? Al Gore?      The ice coverage at both poles has expanded to record levels it has not melted at all. Remember, Al Gore said it would be all gone by 2015. LOL. The glaciers are just fine too. Climate Change/Globull Warming is a political power grab and nothing else.      By the way, ice data from the  Pole indicates that it was actually er 100 years ago than it is now. So how is that "global ing" today?????  	31	2

2018-05-16 23:38:17	cyber poacher	When H2O freezes it expands. Thus, when it makes a change of state ( solid (ice) to water(liquid)) it's volume will be less than when it is frozen. In addition, when ice melts (phase change) it will absorb energy ( heat) maintaining a constant temperature. This will moderate the outside air temperature because of the heat absorption of the H20. Thus , the surface temperatures should not be increasing because the melting ice moderates the temperature through heat abortion until all of the H2O has melted. Furthermore, This will occur over two phases. Ice to water and water to vapor. Therefore the volume of water as we know it will be decreasing do to heat absorption in the two changes of state ( solid to liquid, and liquid to vapor) .      However, a greater amount of H2O will be absorbed into the atmosphere as water vapor ( stream),. Therefore, increasing the amount of latent heat in the atmosphere when the water vapor begins to condense (vapor to liquid) do to the cooler temperatures at higher altitudes. The earth will see a greater amount of storm activity and spot flooding as apposed to an aggregate rise in overall water levels as this video portrays.  	33	6

2018-05-16 03:30:22	MegaTechpc	Well its a good thing that ALL the ice on the planet is not going to melt then isn't it? I mean, this premise is so ridiculous it doesn't even bear mentioning, yet we get bludgeoned over the head with it every single day. Sure, over the next 500,000 years we might see radical changes to the Earth's current climate (you know, basically like Earth's climate has radically changed over time for the entire existence of the planet), but this planet has never been a static planet and there will be plenty of time to adapt to whatever changes happen. You people do realize that 10,000 years ago the entire planet was covered with ice right? Obviously it isn't today, so there was quite a lot of global ing going on for 10 millennia before humans even had the ability to create significant emissions, yet now we are told by all these geniuses (who are constantly proven wrong in all of their dire, fear- mongering rhetoric) that we all have to get rid of our , planes, trains, power plants, etc to "fix" the planet. I personally think what we should do is continue to strive for cleaner and more efficient technology (as we have already been doing for decades) and simply adapt to whatever changes the Earth has in store for us. I mean, we couldn't stop the Earth's climate from changing (one way or another) even if 100% of humans decided to dedicate their entire lives to it. The climate (and yes, the land/water boundaries) of today is not the one true "correct" climate (remember Pangaea?) and as a species, adaptation has always been the key to survival for EVERY life form on the planet. That's not changing even if we all go out and buy Tesla's tomorrow...  	31	2

2018-05-16 00:03:58	Daniel Rains	Replying to the replies.   Water expands so level would indeed be slightly lower.   Second. Yes im aware they r land masses but so is the bottom of the sea a land mass. It is speculation to immediately assume that the ice would melt n melting water wouldnt just cover the "land mass. But until all of the ice is melted the remaining ice would displace the melting water n may cause short term flooding.  	5	6
2018-05-15 23:23:32	Titanium Gamer	Many things wrong with this map Frist Los angles would die plus the Connecticut river would not expand it would stay the same and Mexico would be damaged and California would have a Bay inside it  	1	3

2018-05-15 17:28:02	kristen scarbrough	It would get so hot there would be no life everything would eventually die, plants would slowly dry up and fires would be more prevalent and oxygen would be deprived slowly over time water level would rise creating hurricane from the  of the climate as the ice caps melting. Iron in water would rise water would turn red then you would see more toxic blooms of algea because they like  water so their locations would no longer be limited and eventually it will poison the waters and kill the masses of fish like the Biblical prediction...  	5	3

2018-06-11 03:20:34	Escape From Zombie Island	Wasn't born here, after living here 2 years I feel I need to tell people that, but there are no crickets in rural TN this year. Kind of troubling considering many of the trees are looking much worse and bug populations also look weak. People can deny it all they want. Thia is happening unless a mass awakening happens in the next little while, one year or less. I had to move out here due to the proliferation of cell phones towers, smart meters etc.  	29	9

Climate models are fudged by 45% AND they don't take into account force's outside of the earth's atmosphere, like Solar changes etc... Global ing or climate change or whatever you call it next is just a control mechanism by the elites to control the world's population!

So far what we have been seeing is a cooling effect and 4 years of record high global sea ice, increase populations of polar bears and no significant sea level rise. When do I start panicking?

2018-05-09 23:52:47	Rumple Stiltskin	Remember my friends, that all those computer programs and algorithms cannot do their job without human input, that is where I question the results of this kind of fear mongering bull shit. Also remember that when Ice melts the volume of water from the melt does not equal what was the volume of the ice because water expands when it freezes. I guarantee you they do not take that into consideration. I would be very surprised if all the oceans would rise more than a foot at most.      These supposed educators run this crap out every now and then to hype their latest computer models to give the impression that they supposedly know all about Global ing, which they now call Climate Change. The facts prove that over all our earth, it hasn't increased in temperature more than one degree, if that much, in hundreds of years. By the way our sun has more to do with our climate changing that do humans on this little blue pearl of a planet !!!  	31	2

2018-05-08 18:56:09	Daniel Rains	Have a question. If u put two large cubes of ice in a glass of water n mark water level on glass then let the ice melt would water be above the mark or below??? Water expands as it freezes creating more volume. Wen it melts there is less volume making water level in glass decrease not increase. Please just think about it for one second n ull see that this video is fear mongering bull. Ty  	33	6
2018-07-18 10:01:53	Ray Watson	+JMR Well done for asking the question then. I did see that part of your comment, which is why I made the "young learner" comment. Sometimes on internet comments, "I could be wrong", isn't always sincere, so I'm glad you have an open mind.  rains comment is correct IF you assume all ice is floating. The trouble is, that MOST ice is on land, and has yet to fall INTO the glass, so to speak.  	33	6
2018-07-18 09:37:20	JMR	yes im in between 8th 9th grade thats why i said "or i can be wrong"  	27	5
2018-07-18 09:27:38	Ray Watson	+JMR You mustn't have done High School science yet. Why do frozen water pipes burst ? Water is rare, it does expand with freezing, but tha's not the point. Antarctica and  are like glasses of water with Ice Cubes sitting on the lip of the glass, not in the water.. When those ice cubes not in the water, but sitting up on the 'land' do melt, the water will overflow out of the glass.. If you ONLY had ice cubes IN the drink, then the level of the water would go down just a little bit when they melt.  	33	6
2018-07-17 22:03:40	JMR	How the heck does something expand when it freezes? Only hot things expand (or i can be wrong idk) and also of course the water level would rise up where do u think the water from the ice cubes will go ?  	33	6
2018-07-08 09:24:50	Ray Watson	I cant believe so many fools are talking about melting ice not raising the actual sea level It's the ice from the top of LAND in  and Antarctica and the few Glaciers left ( ie not IN the glass yet) that will raise the oceans. That's why scientists get paid the big bucks, and not the s off the street.  	5	6
2018-06-23 06:56:29	LordTeagan62	Would these same physics with a glass function with the size of a planet though? ( Just a question to throw out there (. The volume of the water would change since most of the ice is above the water. The  that an object takes up in the water, makes the water rise. An "icecube", even with water expanding as it freezes. Would still add much more water than the ice alone. How come with a cup of water filled with ice cubes the water rises after it melts.. Same concept. The reason ice cubes do not raise water unless melted is because it's less dense than water, thus a fraction of it is really in the water. This is an observation you can do yourself.  	33	6
2018-06-21 04:55:12	nilesable	 Rains...What happens if you fill the glass,put a rigid screen on top of it and put the ice on the screen to melt into the glass? It's going to overflow. Now realize that +/-10% of the earths land is covered in ice,some of that ice is miles thick.  	33	6
2018-06-20 01:32:54	HotRodRay	 .... Ice is NOT DENSER than water. That's why it floats.  	33	6
2018-06-20 01:29:25	HotRodRay	 Rains ... The level does not change when the ice melts. Were you asleep that day at school, or did the libtards not teach that? That was taught in elementary school general science class through the 1960s.  	5	6
2018-06-18 21:32:18	The Devil In The Circuit	Float ice in a glass? It's not that simple. More realistically--put some dry land in the glass, and then stack some ice cubes on it. You have to remember that there's a lot of ice (glaciers, etc.), on the earth that is supported by dry land.  	33	6
2018-06-17 03:15:55	Comic Sans	Your kidding right?  	8	7
2018-06-16 00:31:05	mattyoxide	 100% incorrect. Ice is LESS dense than water - that’s why it floats. Water EXPANDS when freezing - unlike most substances. You might like to check out hydrogen bonding. High school chemistry.  	33	6

2018-05-25 02:11:05	Bruce Tucker	Those glaciers in temperate regions don't have enough water to have much effect on seas levels, but their disappearance will actually cause an even worse problem: without glacial meltwater rivers like the Yangtze, Ganges, and the Mekong that make life possible for hundreds of millions of people will lose most of their flow.  	5	6
2018-05-22 07:12:32	gerald christie	mark the level of the water before the ice is added. Then add the ice cubes. The water level rises by the amount of ice you add. After you add the ice and the water level remains the same but is still higher then the water level before the ice was added.  	33	6
2018-05-21 21:48:07	Leafsdude	@Elgarlen - The OP's also limiting the scope of analysis to two factors: the ice melt and the water temperature. Even the factor that's causing the ice melt is being ignored: increasing air temperatures. Eventually, as sea ice decreases, that increased air temperature will caused the cooled water from melting to  again, removing the contracted area and once again raising sea levels. And that's not considering the fact that the cooling will be heavily localized. We've already seen this with Antarctica. Some localized areas saw an increase in sea ice in the early 2010s due partially to cooled sea temperatures from glacial melt (though also due to localized ocean currents and weather patterns as well). Those changes were highly temporary, as the increase has already disappeared and sea ice has now decreased to beyond where they were before the increase.  	31	6
2018-05-16 18:56:34	People's Front of Canada	So global ing is a myth hey?...look at a satellite pic of the glaciers in the 50's when they first started taken sat. photos.Then look at those same glaciers/pictures now.Then tell me again how its not happening.The dam polar bears have algae growing on their fur its so dam  up here,Also, we now really have a north-west passage in , and in a few years they will be running tours through it.  	20	2
2018-05-15 23:19:17	Endoph Daize	Just maybe their would be a larger cloud cover to the earth so a lot of the water would be in the atmosphere and the land would be greener and er... just like the it has been for most of it's existence. We are just coming out of an ice age and the average global temp now is only 14.5 degrees C, the high global temperature average is 22 degrees C.  	5	6
2018-05-15 16:02:11	Emmanuelle Hernandez Morales	Elgarlen Yeah. Then it becomes like chucking more ice cubes in a glass of water. The water level would definitely rise.  	33	6
2018-05-15 01:40:55	Cole	Your physics analysis is incomplete. What happens when you put ice cube in water? -They float. How much water gets pushed out by the submerged part of the ice cube? -The same volume of water that equates the mass of whole ice cube. Therefore, if the ice cube melt, it just fills the volume that the submerged part of the cube pushes out. So the water level remains the same. Now, add the ice that's sitting on solid land.  	33	6

I ain't selling my house anytime soon. It's like when 40 years ago they said that there would be no fish left in the ocean in just 10 years. Well there's plenty of fish in the ocean still.      Liars.  	1	3
2018-05-15 17:52:48	Nuno Foo	I live in south Florida and they been saying this was gonna happen 10 years ago and it hasn't. Really? They predicted a sea level rise of 60 meters by 2018 in 2008? Where did you hear that? Can you link to the scientific paper that predicted that? I bet you can't. Because  remotely respected in the scientific community ever said anything close to that. "Liars." Liars? wanna hear a lie? People that say that it was predicted in 2008 that there was going to be a sea level rise of 60 meters in 10 years. Now that is a lie.  	31	3

In that case, it would be sad that the US wasn't sharing such valuable technology with the world. But, this here is just a simple video with the intended target audience being ns. It is not a company's job to consider what the world thinks. Just because the world wants it doesn't mean Business Insider *must* produce a certain video. It's its own company.  	28	0

2018-05-22 22:02:50	ElectricDragon	 Ok, now you're just being not smart. "They release it globally" Is that really your reason? This is YouTube, a platform in which videos exist, no matter the audience. For example, if someone is doing a rant video on Overwatch, the target audience is probably Overwatch fans, not the world. Basically, with your logic, I can just go to a Fortnite channel's video and comment something like, "there are soooooo many videos about Fortnite. I don't care about the game, yet they release these dumb videos globally." Don't you understand how stupid that sounds? YouTube is host to a *variety * of audiences, not just you. Just because *you* don't like a video on YouTube doesn't mean the video should just stop existing. You can see that from the 41K likes the video has.  	7	5
2018-05-22 10:53:52	Rj Pena	Films thats why im complaining that it's bias and soooooo many things are made for ns yet they release it globally.  	7	5
2018-05-22 02:44:26	ElectricDragon	 I said this before. Business Insider is not only based in , it was founded by an n, so its target audience is reasonably... ns. This shouldn't be surprising. Businesses, especially those in the media category, will usually have a bias of some sort. CNN has its opinions, and so do many other companies. If you don't care about , there are probably plenty other channels and videos that cover global ing's effect on the Earth. Why are you just calling almost 320 million people morons? If anything, you should call out Business Insider for this, not 320,000,000 people.  	20	2
2018-05-22 00:25:30	Rj Pena	Films Why are you telling me about global ing when im not even talking about it im saying buisness insider has favorites and we dont share there favorites.  	20	2
2018-05-21 20:25:54	ElectricDragon	 Just because someone is an n means they think global ing is fake? Now you're just discriminating. As I already told you, not every n believes that global ing is fake. I, for one, believe in the threat that global ing poses against the world, and I'm *n!* Also, maybe this channel is based in  or something and that's why they "showed  in greater detail." Not everything has to have an ulterior motive. Edit: I looked it up, and yes, Business Insider is based in *New York City.*  	20	2
2018-05-21 15:16:24	Rj Pena	Films of course an n would say there is nothing wrong. and lot still isint enough like what they showed in the  part great deatail while other country didn't get a chance.  	9	0

I know you're trying to say the the USA isn't everything, but you are creating a completely dumb and illogical argument yourself. You managed to make an anti-n argument out of absolutely nothing.

2018-05-03 20:35:03	Frederick Wise	As I recall, 9/10's of an  is ALREADY UNDER WATER. so only the melting 1/10 will add to..... Land Ice ts that are melting are doing so because of volcanic action around or even under them!! Oh BTW here it is 2018 and Al Gore's property on the California coast hasnt gone under yet , not a SMIDGE!!! As with all other coast lines. Talked to a friend in Fla 2 weeks ago. He said he has been going to the same beach for 49 years and it has not gone under any!!!!   Any coast that IS going under is due to SUBDUCTION (geology - look it up) There are coasts (and islands) that are rising because their tectonic plate (again geology - look it up) is over riding the one being subducted. Tuvalu as an example is rising out of the ocean because the n plate is crashing into the Pacific plate causing it to buckle (up in places, down in others) GPS stats cant keep up with the location of places in  because of the rapid motion north and east.  	31	6

2018-05-02 11:12:13	N1v3K77	I call BS on this whole ice melting theory, because...   A. Most of the ice on the poles is situated below sea levels to begin with and...   B. The volume of the ice decreases as soon as it melts.      Try this simple small scale experiment:   Take a bucket and fill it with a LOT of icecubes, a few inches from the top. Now fill it with water untill it is just below the ice level. Take a marker and mark the water level. Seal the bucket so nothing can evaporate and wait till all off the ice has melted.   You will see that the water level will stay the same, completely against the theory.  	5	6

2018-05-26 23:40:33	rocketman697	Now take the ice and place it in a funnel that is suspended over the glass of water, and then observe what happens to the water level when the ice melts.  	33	6
2018-05-26 21:55:27	tim m	 the ice melting is not the problem .the problem is the ing of the oceans . if you heat water it expands . take water at 60 degrees and fill the glass to the brim. when the water heats to 64 degrees the water will expand and rise above the rim. now when all the water in the oceans heats up the expansion will cause the ocean level to increase.  	5	6
2018-05-26 20:42:59	Incredibly Bored	Sorry if I am not understanding, but if you put ice in the water, measure the volume of the water WITH the ice in it, it wont increase much, because the water in the ice will most likely not change volume, because you cannot compress water. The experiment is faulty then.  	33	6
2018-05-26 03:57:53	Yoon Dohyeon	it's saltwater. if you put ice in saltwater and watch it melt. also increasing temperature expands the volume of water.  	33	6
2018-05-25 19:42:26	Bruce Tucker	Yes, it is, and you don't seem to understand how it works. Adding empty volume to a ship or ice cube without changing the weight doesn't increase the amount of water it displaces, it just increases the amount of ship or ice cube that is floating above the water level. You could make an ice cube with 1mm thick walls and nothing but air inside and it would not displace any more water than it would if you melted it and refroze it without any of the air in it. (Again ignoring the weight of the air, which is going to be 2-3 milligrams.) A 100,000 ton cruise ship displaces exactly the same amount of water as a 100,000 ton oil tanker even though the volume of the cruise ship is much greater. In the example at hand , the question was whether the water level in a glass would change if ice cubes that were floating in the water melted. It would not make one bit of difference whether those ice cubes were half bubbles/half ice or entirely gas-free. The bubbly cubes will float higher but the effect of their melting will be the same, the water level will not change.  	33	6

2018-05-25 11:58:51	Caden Grace	Its called displacement. Look it up, it is the whole reason ships float.  	35	3
2018-05-25 07:48:41	Jim Lemmon	Put Ice in a Glass add some Cream Liqueur and some Butter Scotch Snapps and you have a Copper Camel...  	15	6
2018-05-25 06:20:17	Bruce Tucker	No, I was busy making an A in Physics 101 which you apparently slept through. Unless you can explain to me how adding air bubbles is going to make the cube displace any more water. (I mean, technically the air weighs something, but it's about 1/1000 the weight of water, so it's not really significant at the scale we're talking about.) Maybe you need to brush up on how a floating object displaces water (hint: it's based on weight, not volume, and it has nothing to do with chemistry).  	33	3
2018-05-25 05:56:21	Caden Grace	I see you failed chem 101  	37	5
2018-05-25 05:48:32	Bruce Tucker	The air bubbles don't matter. The only difference they make is how high above the water the top of the cube will float while it's still unmelted. If you have a 50 gram ice cube, it's going to displace 50cc of water when it's an ice cube and it's going to occupy 50cc when it's melted. Adding another 10cc of air inside the ice won't make it displace any more or less water either as a solid or a liquid. (Unless you have something pushing the unmelted ice cube down into the water.)  	33	6
2018-05-25 05:32:46	Caden Grace	In addition to the postings by others to prove your line of thinking in error, you make a basic error in assuming that ice cubes from your freezer are the same kind of ice at the poles - it is nothing like it. Cubes from your freezer have a lot of trapped air bubbles, hence why the water lever drops when the ice melts because part of the cube's volume being made of air, but Artic and Antarctic ice has almost no air in it.  	33	6
2018-05-25 02:00:00	Bruce Tucker	There's also isostatic rebound to factor in. Those massive, heavy ice ts push Antarctica and  down pretty far - in most of  the land under the ice is actually below sea level. Take the heavy ice away and that land starts to rise, when it rises it displaces water, and that water has to go somewhere. However, I don't think even the worst-case scenarios have all the ice on Antarctica melting or anywhere near it. (Also, isostatic rebound takes thousands of years. Much of  and northern Europe are still rebounding from the glaciers that melted 15,000 years ago). Ice melting in the glass shouldn't change the water level at all. The ice is slightly less dense than liquid water, but that means a corresponding portion of the ice floats above the water level. When the ice melts the resulting liquid water fills the exact volume of ice that was at or below the water level when the ice was still solid.  	31	6
2018-05-25 01:47:50	BarryEssex	Thanks. I Think you have answered my question.  	27	5
2018-05-24 14:47:45	Zamijo	This conversation is becoming redundant. I have already answered this question. There IS NO proof. This "irrefutable proof" does not exist. You cannot prove that we are not in a simulation. You cannot prove that gravity exists. However, in the case of global ing, there is a substantial amount of evidence to suggest it does indeed exist. But no, there is no proof, and what you ask is an impossible question.  	35	2
2018-05-24 14:36:09	BarryEssex	I agree with most of what you say. The proof tho? Where is it?  	19	5
2018-05-24 14:17:46	Zamijo	In my opinion there is enough evidence to consider global ing an extremely likely scenario, given the scientific community's consensus on the existence of it. For now, I think it is important to try and solve issues the world faces to hopefully make it a better place for others, and if not others, then at least yourself. This problem should be solved now rather than later, to make it easier on everyone. Sadly, there are big companies that survive off emitting greenhouse gases or selling products that emit greenhouse gases, that are willing to prevent solutions from being reached. Politics and greed are far too involved in this problem, as you stated.  	20	2
2018-05-24 13:48:32	BarryEssex	I agree with your argument my friend. I just find it funny how we all have to change our lives so suddenly without, as you say, proof. It seems more like politics than bravery  	37	5
2018-05-24 13:23:55	Zamijo	I cannot provide you with irrefutable proof. Such a thing does not exist. There is no irrefutable proof for gravity, yet we assume it is there based on evidence. Global ing is much the same. Although it cannot be proven 100%, evidence can be collected that provides reasoning as to why it is occurring. If you ask for proof, you will not receive it. Likewise, you cannot provide proof of your claims. We can simply show evidence of either standpoint and determine which is the most probable. In this case, global ing and its causes are more likely to exist than to not exist, given the evidence I have seen. I respect opinion, and if there is a breakthrough and proper evidence is provided, I would happily disregard global ing. However, there is simply not enough evidence to disprove this. As for my "proof" of humans causing global ing, which is not proof but evidence, see the links I have posted earlier.  	20	2
2018-05-24 12:55:44	BarryEssex	What's "proof". I thought proof was irrefutable? So. Where is your proof of humans causing it?  	37	2
2018-05-24 12:17:48	Zamijo	In science, nothing can be proven 100%, but global ing is certainly a probable event. Instead, I can gather evidence on the topic. Here is your "proof".    intermediate.htm  ocean-heat-powerful-climate-change-evidence-global-ing This is a very small number of sources that were extremely easy to find, with a quick google search, but nonetheless credible. Feel free to give me some credible sources that provide argument to these. I can give you more "proof" if you so desire.  	20	2
2018-05-24 11:42:09	BarryEssex	Nonsense, show me the proof  	37	5
2018-05-24 11:13:11	Zamijo	I agree with them, actually. Conclusive studies and data collected over many years by many trusted sources that reach similar conclusions help to provide evidence that something is happening here, as a result of our increased emissions of carbon dioxide, among other things.  	20	2
2018-05-24 08:01:20	BarryEssex	Interesting to know that all scientists agree with you  	37	2

2018-05-22 04:57:51	Barttoocool	Real experiment se.. fill a glass of water up to the top. Get a block of ice 1/4 the size of the glass. Place it on top of the glass and leave it out for a few hours... basically whats going on right now lol  	33	6
2018-05-22 04:55:48	Barttoocool	 its not expanding, waters getting diluted so it grows temporarily to a bigger size, but itd getting worse  	33	3
2018-05-22 04:04:07	Adam Carter	Water expands when it freezes. Yes, in a glass of water the water level drops. The problem with the earth is there's a lot of ice on the land and it's piled up so when it melts the water levels will rise. A more accurate experiment would be fill your tub with ice and make the hill of ice go 3 feet above your tub and see what happens.  	33	6
2018-05-22 01:13:06	no soul	how about fill up a glass with water and then add the ice cubes ???? i think it will over flow..... these not just ice on water.... but also ice on land,,,,  	33	6
2018-05-21 21:54:19	Leafsdude	What about if you measure 10 minutes after the ice melts? 30 minutes? An hour? If you leave the glass at room temperature, you will eventually see the level rise above the original point again as thermal expansion supersedes the original displacement. Limiting your measuring to such a precise moment is cherry-picking data. Pretty much the only thing climate change "skeptics" are good at.  	20	6
2018-05-21 18:46:11	George Steele	The we are talking about  because Antarctica is still well below freezing. By the way, moron, if yo want to insult, plenty of alarmist have said that the sea ice melting was going to raise sea levels.  	5	6
2018-05-21 04:38:03	chucky	ummm dipstick tre talking about the ice shelves that are MILES high ABOVE the water, not sitting in it like an ice cube... hundreds of square miles of ABOVE water level ice...duh..  	33	6
2018-05-20 16:36:59	dukestreetking75	You aren't displacing water if ice that is currently ON LAND MASSES melts and becomes part of the world's oceans. Your little experiment sounds like the morons in Congress who are bought and paid for. Why don't you put a block of ice on your living room floor, let it melt, and then try to tell me that your living room is just as dry as it was before. What a fool.  	5	6
2018-05-20 14:39:34	George Steele	Put a rock in a glass and fill it to the brim, then put an ice cube in, the displacement will push the water over the brim until the level of water is the same as the brim. then when the ice melts, nothing except no ice.  	33	6
2018-05-20 04:51:22	George Steele	It is not a question of hating scientists. It is the politicization of the issue where the religion you worship is global ing.  	20	2
2018-05-20 04:50:25	George Steele	Ice would not be under the water; ice is less dense so it floats.  	5	6
2018-05-20 04:49:27	George Steele	Try not to be dense. The arctic ice lies on water. It is supported by water. If it melts nothing to the level of the water would happen. As far as Antarctica, it never gets above freezing. Not even close. Try this: Put an ice cube in a measuring cup and then fill it exactly to a level and then check it when the ice melts.  	5	6
2018-05-20 04:47:10	George Steele	 would happen, maybe even slightly lower levels. That is because of displacement.  	18	1
2018-05-19 13:44:38	reference2me	so ...how much of the ice is under water??  	33	6

2018-05-18 23:34:36	Andreas Sjöberg	All I hear from half the comments is the ignorance which is the result of home-schooling and lack of proper public education. Let me now add another news article, because of the rotation of the earth, even MORE water than in the simulation will end up at the equator, and also the rotational axis of the earth will move, because the center of gravity will be significantly shifted by the water! It will go very fast when the melting truly picks up in ernest. Just melting ice in antarctica will make ice fall off from land and into the sea, which will radically increase sea-levels even before it finishes melting. Now do your experiment over. Take a glass of water, fill it to the brim. Then put a slab of ice across it. Wait and watch the carnage when it melts just enough to break in half in the middle from the stress of its own weight, and fall into the already full glass, spashing water all over your table. That will happen in your lifetime, and if you live within 15 meters of maximum tide limit today, start thinking about selling your house and moving while you get good money for your home!  	31	6
2018-05-18 21:36:48	Flower Mask	If all the ice in the ocean, like the poles or large glaciers melted, nothing would happen, since the ice is still taking up the same amount of  even when melted, but if all the ice on land melted the water level would rise  	5	6
2018-05-16 10:50:10	lindy919	If you're trying to say that melting ice ts won't raise sea level then your brain doesn't work  	5	6

So, yeah, they do have a big reason to lie and fudge their data to support their conclusions, as they have been proven to have done in the past.  	20	2
2018-05-14 21:25:22	Alex	Took the water. Measured. Dumped ice in, then melted. Measured. 1 cup became 1 1/3 cups. Yeahhh.... sure.... TOTALLY doesn't rise...  	33	6

2018-05-10 19:57:39	universalchiro	The polar ice is above sea level. Antarctica is a continent. So your argument is flawed by thinking that the ice melting in water has no change to the water level because that is not how the polar caps are situated. The polar caps are not ice floating within water. If they were, then your argument would have merit. I hope this helps.  	5	6

2018-05-09 01:14:54	Sparky Jones	Water does evaporate. I dunno if you guys or the scientists are aware of that but it happens, yup, turns right into vapor, and rises up into the sky forms clouds, moves and causes rain somewhere. I don't think they've really thought that far though. Just want to show the drama of a sea level rise when in fact all bodies of water would rise as well as the ground water table. All low lying areas would be affected. Lakes would increase. It would rain or snow in places that don't get rain or snow normally. Tren't talking about that no sir. They want the flood drama that's likely to not happen at a rapid pace and will evaporate off and move inland and become ground water.  	31	3

2018-05-08 16:30:45	PikaPluff2040	So like i said: - If the ice is under the water (in the cup), obviously the water level will drop because ice takes up more volume (less dense) and water is DISPLACED. - If the ice is above the water (like antarctica or arctic), when it melts, the water levels will rise because NOTHING is being displaced.  	33	6
2018-05-08 16:22:07	PikaPluff2040	ice is displacing water? yeah so if water does heat up and expand, the volume of water increase, so sea levels rise. Do you believe in sea levels rising or not?  	33	6
2018-05-08 13:06:04	E. Rijpstra	 I'm not convinced, you have heard of and understand displacement? The ice is displacing water. And if water is heating up you'll have expansion then evaporation.  	33	6
2018-05-08 10:42:49	Sparky Jones	 happens. Their more water under the earth's crust than in the oceans. It's nonsense science, just like we were suppose to run out of fish in the ocean 40 years ago. That never happened either.  	5	3
2018-05-08 07:31:53	Arthur	Indeed, if artica ice melts nothing will happen but if antarctica does, the sea level will rise a lot. However antarctica's ice is expending so no worries.  	5	6
2018-05-08 01:49:02	Aidan S.	What are you trying to prove?  	37	5
2018-05-04 22:03:50	PikaPluff2040	And remember, the poles (Antarctica, Arctic) have ice ABOVE sea level, so if the whole thing melted, the overall change will lead to sea levels rising.  	5	6
2018-05-04 22:02:49	PikaPluff2040	Its not a hoax. Listen, sea levels are rising because of: - the thermal expansion of water (water expands when heated up caused by global ing) - LAND BASED ice melting,  	20	6

2018-05-30 04:40:43	Leafsdude	@Simi-Random n Things - Not true. Temperatures today sit around 1 degree above the 1950-1990 average. "Roman times" range from -0.4 to 0.4 degrees above that same average. Moreso, nearly all studies support the fact that current temperatures are rising exponentially. Not only that, but 17 out of 18 datasets that reach far back enough say temperatures have been on a steep incline since around 1800. The only dataset that disagrees is tiansen and Ljungqvist (2012) (CL12loc), which says that temperatures declined between 1970-1995 following a steep incline beginning around 1900, but a relatively stagnant climate from 1600-1900.

There's more matter to hold heat, so it gets hotter.  is closer to the sun.  rotates so slowly its day is longer than its year.  has almost no axial tilt (1.7 degrees). All of these in addition to its insanely dense atmosphere contribute to its heat (average of 900F.) The Earth won't become a second  until the sun gets much hotter later in its life span. The acidification of the ocean due to it having to absorb more CO2 will be the collapse of our biosphere. Still, humanity will find a way to survive even if we are stupid enough to not care about sustainable energy. Deny man made climate change all you want. You can't argue against the benefit of developing efficient methods of clean energy and renewable resources.

Maybe that will put an end to the political romanticization of the old confederacy.   Every thing changes. There are reasons why mass extinctions have been  by such climate changes. Everything changes. Change with it, or die. That really is the choice facing us.  	3	1

2018-04-30 17:27:18	Andy Galloway	If you want to be taken seriously, my advice is get better at the language you are trying to communicate in. At the moment you might well have a valid point worth making, but  knows. Screaming "ignorant" at people doesn't help either - you are displaying huge levels of ignorance, revealing a massive hypocrisy on your part - further devaluing your s.

2018-05-07 11:57:41	Karolina Motuzyte	 it is a big deal. Since the people would have to move, cities would be more crowed.

2018-03-20 20:21:40	Know Name	FYI: the earth, over its 4.567 billion year history, has gone through many climate cycles/changes, etc. As far as the hypothesis put forward here, the earth HAS been "ice free" for periods lasting in the 100s of millions of years; when the earth was in these er periods (i.e., much er than today, since there's ice at both poles); there were no ice ts/ice cover at the poles. Now & then an isolated patch of ice would develop, potentially anywhere on the planet but due to the er climate which existed, these individual patches of ice would form but soon melt. When, after a LOOONGG period of time the average temp on earth started dropping a bit the aforementioned blocks of ice would form but due to the temperature not being  enough to melt it & thus herald a new ice age. (BTW, earth is STILL in an ice age; it has been for the past 50-100k years but, as with all ice ages, there are cycles when glaciers abound & come down from the poles & spread out wide & then, as with the current climate for the past 10-12k years, you have what's called an "interglacial period" when the ice ts/glaciers retreat back up to the poles. That's one way to tell that the earth is still in an ice age: the existence of the remaining ice that exists at the poles. But, there is NOTHING novel about the earth being completely "ice-free".  	31	6

2018-05-07 16:58:45	David Radtke	 I certainly know that Schliemann found the wrong Troy. Even the cities underneath the rebuilt one could still not prove its troy. They were destroyed by earthquakes and fires. Homer's Troy also could be Wilusa. The archeologists are still not certain, the city on Hisarlik Tepe is Troy.  	14	2
2018-05-07 16:02:52	Bruce Wilson	 cities were destroyed on a regular basis. Survivors would simply build on the crushed and burnt ruins. Over time the city mound, or "tel" would rise in height. Archeoligist would dig trenches through the mound, revealing layers much like a layer cake. The challenge is identifying which of the 20 layers or so was the historical city of record. So there were many Troys, but they were all built on the same site.  	14	3

People doing the math are forgetting a couple important calculations; they figure out the ice mass as not being 90% under water already, tre forgetting that water shrinks when it melts, and tre calculating based on a flat map not a spherical planet, factor all these things in and the ocean doesn't rise very much if the ice melts, it's sensationalist news, the same news that claimed years ago we would have the ocean rise already, we haven't and we won't.  	31	6

Canadian health ministry was the first to develop a vaccine for the H1N1 outbreak.  co-founded and developed the IMAX screen in theaters, 's governor general (I think), shot the terrorist that had breached and entered parliament hill in 2014 that Trudeau will happily bring in more again later on. Canadian Armed Forces were the first to develop the CADPAT digital camouflage pattern which  indoctrinated into it's Armed Forces.  was the first to develop a super sonic jet fighter in the 60's known as the avro arrow, but later scrapped due to budgeting problems and slight suspicions the US told us to scrap em, oh the list goes on. So  has done significant things, it's just  ever gave a shit. And  is a bilingual country, it can speak more than just one language whatever it likes due to it's ch and British history.  has their own conflicting civil war history. Should  deserve some recognition, I say so. Tell you what, if  allows it's citizens to have their own weapons and less gun laws governing fire arms, volunteered in more wars that only create more lives lost and families devastated, and became a significant contributor on inventing and manufacturing weapons and nuclear arms capable of killing millions of civilian lives, would you say  is significant?  	31	2

2018-02-24 11:31:02	Silver Man4567	You do realise that even if the ice melted, the would not be any flooding, you see if, for example, a ice block was in the cup and it started melting, it would still be the same volume of water, test this theory at home! This is how you test it:   •Get a glass cup   •Fill it up with water   •Put a big dot on the glass cup where the water ends   •Fill it with ice   •Do step three again   •Wait for it to melt   •When all the ice melts check the second dot and you will se that the water is still at the are when there was ice in it      I hope this theory has made you feel great again (➰-➰)   Before you knew: |•o•) AHHHH   After you knew: | ; - ; ) why was I so dumb  	33	6

Its kind of the same with putting an ice cube in water, because the water rises when’s you put solid mass in. By it melting, it raises sea levels, but also lowers it, because less solid mass is in the water.  	5	6

2018-02-03 14:49:31	Sarah Wibel	If I float ice in a glass of water and then melt the ice, the water level lowers because frozen water expands. The only way water levels will rise on earth is if there is more ice on top of landmass at north and south poles than the ice floating in the ocean at those poles.  	5	6
2018-05-03 20:54:08	Frederick Wise	, Ignore the dufuses! IPCC is more full of crap than a turkey fattened for tmas!! Al Gore bought property on the Calif coast.

2018-01-23 02:31:12	Richard Cranium	Not even close to the real thing.  alone adds like 24 feet to ocean totals. Then add 200 more feet if Antarctica is gone and you get the real picture. But it’s actually worse than that because scientists say the  “globally” but that’s not accurate because the earth is spinning it puts more water at the equator; theoretically could be twice as much water or more. So, 224 feet globally really means 448 feet at the equator. Check out a topo map of earth and examine the color scheme of everything under 448 elevation. Even if the oceans raised 224 feet it makes the Appalachian mountains islands. The U.S. is 2/3ds gone!!!  	31	6

2018-05-01 22:57:59	Woozler554	 - It's not that sea levels are rising at a "constant rate". The issue is if the sea levels are truly rising, they would rise EVERYWHERE. Why is that concept so hard for you people to understand? Fill up a bowl with water. Notice how the level of the water stays flat? That's the water level, and it's the same thing with the sea. It's not higher in some places and lower in others. The sea level is the same EVERYWHERE. THAT is why the call it sea level. Get it? "... if this isn’t an issue, why are cities like New Orleans, Miami, San Francisco, Tokyo, New York, London, Paris, the entire Netherlands, are investing heavily in more sea defenses?"- I live in NYC, pal. And I'm going to tell you, the sea is no closer to the shore than it was 20 or 30 years ago. This whole thing is a MYTH. FACE UP TO IT. I'm not simple-minded. I'm REALISTIC. Weather changes - it always has, and it always will. You are not seeing anything more than that.  	31	3
2018-05-01 22:53:40	Woozler554	 - Stop trying to sound smart. You're not very good at it.  	38	5
2018-05-01 22:52:56	Woozler554	 - Oh, so now the sea level is not our only concern, eh? Funny, that’s all this video seems to be concerned with. SOME low ground islands completely disappeared into the ocean? If that’s true (which I doubt), then it’s not due to rising sea levels, because if it was, ALL low ground islands would disappear into the ocean. Don’t you get it? That’s how water and sea level works! It would not be localized!!!! You talk like high winds and tropical storms are something new. Here’s a revelation for you: THEY ARE NOT!!! They have occurred throughout history – long before you global ing fanatics were breathing. How EXACTLY have we humans completely thrown the weather out of balance with our activity? You can’t just make the assertion without offering any evidence, and outside of name-calling, put-downs, and hysteria, you haven’t offered a thing.  	31	2
2018-05-01 21:13:55	Vlad Stefan	 You dont understand how weather patterns work, now do you. Let me explain. The sea level is not our only concerne, since we have put defenses against it (especially in the Netherlands and Belgium) but even with that it got so bad that some low ground islands completly dissapeared into the ocean. Our more direct problem are the winds and tropical storms which aggravate due to the changing air currents. While the winds constantly change, we humans completly threw the balance of the charts with our activity. By rising the temperature, and melting the ice, wind patterns (which are determind by air presure which is also determined by areas with different ground temperatures) start flowing in different directions, sometimes in bigger quantities and transporting the conditions from an area (like temperature and precipitations) to another. Just how the wind is  and dry when it moves from Africa towards other places, so is the wind from the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans much more humid. When the temperature starts rising, the ice caps get progressivly er, while releasing more cold water into the ocean (which also changes the sea currents, very important in driving the air currents). As a thought experiment look at a map of the air and sea currents. The imagine the er sea currents in the Atlantic, Paacific and Indian Oceans being pushed by the cold water coming from the poles, which means that hot air currents are also dragged along with them, while of course not to forget the cold air currents moving closer the the Poles as the air pressure changes, leaving vacuum routes for the hot currents to fill up. This back and forth movements of the currents accentuates the circles of current like those in the Caribbean Sea and Indian Ocean, which, surprise, also accentuates the formation rate oftornados and hurricanes.  	31	2
2018-05-01 13:02:14	Woozler554	 - Get a hold of yourself, pal. You're hysterical! Look up the term "sea level". What does it say? As I said before, rising sea levels would not show localized effects in SE Asia or Florida. It would be EVERYWHERE. Do you understand the concept?.....You said it yourself: It would take CENTURIES for all the ice to melt. But the truth of the matter is, it will not....Weather changes - it always has, and it always will. But the idea that our actions will in some way affect it is ludicrous, for as you said, the world is far too big. Think about it, and stop getting so emotional.  	31	2
2018-04-30 15:04:31	Woozler554	 - I'll pose the question to you, genius. After decades of so- called "global ing", why aren't the rides on the century-old boardwalk on Coney Island under water by now? Rising sea levels would not be localized - it would show its effects EVERYWHERE. Hence the term "sea level" - get it?  	11	3
2018-04-30 15:02:01	Woozler554	Tapani Nuolimies - Yes, but most of the time, it was for business, so I had no choice. The last time I was there was in 2000.

Meaning it would recede the seas, not fill them in. There are places all over the earth where the water has disappeared in the ports and harbors. In one place there are ships run aground 20 miles off shore. The water receding from the Gulf of Mexico is draining the Mississippi River. Stop preaching this Al Gore garbage. The exact opposite will happen.  	5	6

Prudent property investors do not purchase multi-million dollar mansions if they truly expect them to be underwater in a few years. But Gore’s choice of ocean front property is just the tip of the , so to speak. Gore’s new beach front mansion sprawls over 1.5 acres (“we all need to reduce our ecological footprint”); contains eight fountains, a ten person spa, and a 100,000 gallon swimming pool, even though ern California is water starved, and alarmists tell us global ing will cause more severe drought and water restrictions; and contains six wood burning fireplaces (because burning carbon-intensive wood in only five fire places at once simply won’t do when entertaining Hollywood friends).  	31	2

2018-04-06 22:12:10	Bozokdraaf	 Why are you assuming that I'm European? I actually have both European and Indian ancestry. My ancestors were diplomats and have lived across the world - from their home in Britain, Portugal and then eventually India - since Elizabeth I's rule. They lived in a time of great prosperity and were quite well-off until Gandhi's Revolution turned their lives upside-down and they had to leave for the UK for fear of being rounded up and executed. They left everything behind and ended up living in relative poverty. Yes, perhaps the  caused similar displacement and poverty - but then again, so did the Moghuls who came before them. All nation states do or have done bad things. Get over it. India is indeed in a post-colonial stage. That means that colonialism is *in the past*. The clue is in the etymology: the prefix "post", deriving from the Latin  of the same name, meaning "after", and most likely ultimately coming from the Proto-Indo-European  *h₁epi, meaning "on" or "near". So, you can just call it, as you put it, "a past" (a strange way to use the indefinite article, but I'll ignore that), because *it happened in the bloody past and you even fucking admitted to it by using the phrase "post-colonial stage"*. And yes, you do indeed need to learn tolerance from a European (albeit a mixed-race European), because unlike you, I don't associate a multitude of ethnic and cultural groups spanning an entire continent with an ideology that has, for the most part, completely died out and only really existed in one out of the fifty-odd countries that make up the continent. Not to mention the fact that it was Britain (along with France, the USA and a few other friends) that fought against  in the Second World War. In answer to your question, "how many people's career and life was ruined just because of showing the Nazi salute?" (sic.), I regrettably am unable to tell you. I was, until today, unaware that "showing" a Nazi salute could ruin anyone's life. Before now, I had always assumed that raising one's right hand in a stiff upwards motion (which is actually not exclusive to the German Werhmacht and similar salutes have been, and still are, used by soldiers from military organisations across the world) was merely a hand gesture, and could in  cause any physical harm to any sort of person, unless they happened to be standing in the way and got hit in the face by the saluter's outstretched hand. However, thanks to you, I have now been made aware that such a gesture can actually destroy a person's career and life, although, alas, you did not provide any sort of detail on exactly how a salute can take someone's occupation and life away. Perhaps it channels some sort of extrasensory power within the human mind? But then surely the Germans would have won the war with great ease, as all they would have had to do was simply outstretch their hands and give praise to their Leader, and then the Allied forces would have fallen down and surrendered, as the gesture's great power would have taken away both their lives and their careers? Perhaps you can elaborate. Now, after wasting ten minutes writing this comment, I suggest that you: A) Learn some tolerance for other countries and folk and make an effort to understand that while the past's events do indeed shape the present, they are outside of anybody's control and, as such, no-one should agonise over past events as they cannot be changed, and they should certainly never be forgotten. B) Improve your English, since the rhythm, grammar, structure, punctuation and overall presentation in your writing is rather difficult to derive any sort of clear meaning from, and it is often rather hard to understand what you're actually trying to say. I look forward to reading your poorly-written reply which will most likely disregard everything that I have taken time out of y to think about and put into s. I am beginning to wonder if perhaps you are a troll.  	13	0

2017-12-26 23:36:10	mark haas	There is no climate crisis. Most CO2 on the earth has been produced by volcanoes ( most are beneath the sea) which still are its primary source. It is the most essential chemical to life after H2O. Carbon dioxide is plant food. Plants on land and Phytoplankton in the oceans are the base of Earth's entire food chain and produce all oxygen as well, as a waste product of converting CO2 into sugars and protein. That's why there are only trace amounts of Co2 in the air. The Global ing scam has been hijacked by the leftist globalists to extract even more wealth from Western countries to fund the UN and their redistributive policies through carbon taxes. This money would be far better spent fighting poverty directly.  	20	2

After they do confront her face to face and tell her everything she just told me. How bad u feel and how u can’t sleep because you’re thinking about it to much. Offer to do something to make the relationship better and tell remind her she is not ugly. Tell her what you want to tell her don’t hold back. People appreciate other people that express all their feelings when tre saying sorry. Good luck ask again if u need any further advice  	38	5

2017-12-23 16:58:53	Cord Cantrell	Not to bad actually. More realistic than the global ing fear mongers idea of what's going to happen. They're videos show everything but just a few mountain peaks getting getting covered. I never could understand how they can say that if the all the ice melts the oceans will raise 3 to 7 feet (depending on which one you want to believe) but it always showed regions that are at a altitude of several thousand feet completely cover by the ocean. I'm sure it's just a simple mistake and is in  meant to mislead the stupid ones.  	31	2
2017-12-23 14:02:59	Sahil Srivastav	Bakwaas...due to melting of ice the momentum of inertia of earth will decrease due to which it will start shifting toward sun and subsequently it will fall in sun. This is reality.  	5	6
2017-12-23 14:00:38	Geoff Parmenter	Except all that floating ice that is currently displacing the water level shrinks when it melts. Heat causes evaporation making earths atmosphere more humid creating plant growth sucking up more water so your argument is invalid. Yeah that means you're lying. Also the same amount of water on the planet in the beginning hasn't changed because of gravity unless you think more water comes from  you know where they found life on all the other planets in the universe. Bunch of mouth breathers can't think on your own.  	33	6

2017-12-10 22:15:48	Odim	Honestly doesn’t look too bad. I mean think about it, the normal state of earth, geologically speaking is with no ice caps. The reason we have so much ice in the poles is because we’re in an ice age. We’ve been in one ever since 2.5 million years ago. It’s called the Pleistociene Ice Age and is the reason we have ice in the poles.      That’s right, the reason there is ice in the poles in the first place is because we’re living in an ice age, so melting all the ice is not such a bad thing for earth, as it would free it from a freakin ice age  	31	6
2017-12-18 20:41:03	Bob Trenwith	Do you need assistance with answering that question?  	38	5

2017-12-15 09:15:05	Odim	+ The earth IS cold, though. That’s why we have ice at the poles. We’re in an ice age  	5	6
2017-12-15 05:54:15	Bob Trenwith	So you are using *definitions* to try to convince people that the earth is cold.  	36	2

2018-01-17 04:27:19	Don Culp	Hey Ron. Try reading some actual scientific journals. You know! The ones written by scientists across the globe? In those articles, please pay attention to the fact that the Earth goes through cycles where the CO2 increases significantly and the Earth s. That way you can feel good that it’s normal. But wait.....the current CO2 levels are 100 times higher. So even if you subtract the baseline increase amount from a cycle.....still with me?.....you still have an abnormal amount of CO2 in the air. Where did it come from? Hmmm....industrial revolution of the late 1800s through today’s industrial revolution of China. Face the truth Ron. We’ve been burning every type of fuel we could get our hands on for 150 years. Wanna see where we’re headed, look at the CO2 blanket on . Reply?  	20	2
2018-01-16 20:59:56	Sofia Filardo	, how? The fact you spread you bull shatty propaganda is making me lmaoooooo!! You have no evidence, and basically deny science for a living. Lololol 😂😂 please so back to school and some damn things for once.  	37	2
2018-01-16 20:56:12	Sofia Filardo	, people like you are retarded. Stfu. A. No water comes from  B. It's not the s we r worrying about dumbass, it's the ice on land. A lot of the North and  pole is ice on land. Since ice on land does not create displacement, in the ocean, it will create a big difference. Not only that, but when ca and  and all the cold places melt, it will SUCK. Your ignorant and dumb. Don't ever say that again. Wake up. The world is not peachy. The world will go underwater at some point. This is not bs, u r.  	5	6

2017-12-11 07:52:59	Bob Trenwith	Ahhh yes - just like the typical denier, when your little foray into science fails, as it must, just pull out the pseudo-political mantra.  	20	2
2017-12-11 00:31:40	Ron Martin	The whole global ing scam is just that a fucking money making scam.  	20	2
2017-12-10 22:02:37	Bob Trenwith	*NO SCIENTIST* is claiming that all ice would melt, not even close to it. Perhaps you didn't read the title of the video - it said *IF* all the ice melted. Do you understand the concept of *IF* ? There was no claim here that this would happen. We have here yet another denier straw man argument.  	5	6

2017-12-10 20:11:52	Bob Trenwith	RM Why do you nuts continue to refer to the 0.2% of earth's ice volume that sits in the ocean and ignore the 99.8% which sits on land? Answer - you don't care about facts ... as long as you can spread your propaganda.  	5	6

We have a tendency to think everything revolves around us. Certain behind the scenes directors are playing on our fears for their own agenda. No pun intended, lol. Tre beat they just don't know it yet. Have a blessed day.  	5	6

2017-12-07 13:20:24	Judgemental Jury	And for the record this is kinda highly inaccurate,water will be evaporated as the ozone is disappearing so when the ice melts it still stays the same.However!! There are some few factors that disapprove my theory,THE WATER CYCLE the water would still keep going back due to the cycle,but actually the ice doesnt actually fully submerges the low lying cities, sometimes ice would travel to near land from the caps and it could melt there decreasing the chance of very catastrophic damage,but Im very sure the leaders would be smart enough to commence early evacuations to farther inland preventing death of people.But then again famous landmarks will be gone,and various landscapes would change very weirdly!!, for example the odds of Arizona getting a beach are pretty high actually,There is a possibility that the water levels could reach far enough to the Sahara desert and would be changed to SAHARA BEACH!!.But I think damages will be more catastrophic, in the North and  if the ice melts it would just rebuild itself and start the melting again and more damages would be afflicted.And thank you for listening (or rather reading) to me ;)  	31	6
2018-04-26 20:21:48	RIP JMC 5	 I agree with you, kindof (I don’t have data to back my claim up so I don’t stand by it very much yet). But a) if the temp of the world got high enough for there to be no ice on it, we would have much bigger problems with crops ect. There would probably be a lot more water in the atmosphere than we think, since now all ocean areas evaporate at higher rates bc of more liquid surface area and higher temps. And due to topogy, how would water get that far inland if the coasts have anything but a flat elevation. We don’t have to worry about flooding, we have to worry about how the weather will change because of the ing. Storms will cause the damage, not water levels.  	31	6
2018-04-21 17:14:39	Reof	if the ozone are gone, i dont think we will give a shit about global ing anymore, by that time we are all cooked alive by the sun's radiation  	3	2
2018-04-19 06:17:07	TR4R	What the hell??? According to your theory the water will evaporate and nothing (well, almost nothing) will happen. You have been smoking weed, I suppose. But what I really think is that realistically not all the ice is going to melt, not even in worst case global ing scenario. Society will collapse due to pollution and resources scarcity besides climate change.  	5	6
2018-04-13 12:28:38	Carosello Show	 no the ozone hole wasnt caused by carbon dioxide or other gases but by the chlorine of chlorofluorocarbons. We already banned the products that had that thing more than 30 years ago but it takes a lot of time for the ozone to recover  	20	2
2018-03-21 13:24:27	argus zz	 repaired in 2050 are you sure. It will take 100 years to cure the ozone if all kinds of gas emission are stopped, including the cigarette you are all smoking to burn your lungs and shorten your life and your children's life.  	20	2

2018-03-21 13:20:38	argus zz	Hahaha they don't understand what would cause all the ice to melt. It means ozone layers are partially destroyed. Before the ice melts in antarctica, the heat there should be ay least 14 degree celcius. In order for antarctica to loose all its glaciers it should be the ozone layer will be the one destroyed first.  	5	6

2017-12-07 01:51:27	C.I.A.	What’s kind of scary is that, this process of the Antarctic Ice melting, will increase in speed with time, because the Antarctic reflects a lot of the suns rays, if there is less of it, that means less rays are reflected, means more heat gets into the earth from the sun, means increasing global temperatures, which mean the Antarctic ice will melt faster! And the whole process repeats again and again until there is nothing left of the icecap.  	5	6

2017-12-06 04:06:36	Rich Paul	Idiocy. Typical liberal horseshit. Take a glass of water that has ice cubes in it. When the ice cubes melt, does the water overflow the glass? Nope. The level remains the same. Actually, it’s becomes slightly less. Most of the earth’s ice is floating on the oceans. True, glaciers are on land. But if they melted, a lot of the water would go into the ground before it reached the oceans.  	5	6
2018-04-04 03:17:58	TheAmir259	I never said ice on poles, the only one i said was *land ice* & *sea ice* . So where in hell did i say pole ice or indicated those ice are (only) on poles?  	5	6

2017-12-02 07:04:31	P. L.	Please understand - this cannot happen. The ice t on Antarctica cannot melt because the climate on Antarctica is isolated from the climate on the rest of the planet. That is so because of the Antarctic Circumpolar ocean current. In fact we know about ancient ice ages from drilling into the ice t on Antarctica. The intermediate  periods have not melt that ice t. Unlike the ice t on . That can melt almost completely away. That will happened some day and that will lead to sea level rise of 8-10 meters on average. However the gravity pull form that ice t is in it self so huge that the disappearance of it will make some of that water "run to the opposite side of the planet" so to speak. So we can expect a sea level rise of 5 meters on the northern hemisphere and 15 meters on the southern hemisphere.  	31	6

2017-11-06 23:21:51	Fangles	We will not exist as a species the next time all the ice is gone, any more than we existed as a species the last time it happened. Our cities and borders will not exist, the keys of Florida and the streets of New York will not be engulfed in monster waves like in movies. By the time this happens again, continental plates and land masses will have shifted and changed, species will have risen and fallen, our own included.      We are still in an ice age, punctuated by a climactic rollercoaster of peaks and troughs. The Earth is still in it's ing phase, or interglacial period, after the last glacial period - an era of tens of millenia - and will continue to , until it reaches it's apogee in around 5,000 to 15,000 odd years marked by a relatively sudden and steep rise in temperature, when it will begin to cool into the next glacial period as it has done many times since the advent of this particular ice age (and our modern ancestors) a coupla million years ago, due to our wobbly orbit.      This is a phenomenon that has and will continue to happen regularly, with or without the existence of Human Beings and their collective governments' exploitation of a natural event to deliver less energy for higher prices and taxation through guilt tripping and scare mongering. The Earth will continue to get er regardless, while the dumb will continue to get dumber and the rich will continue to get richer. Plus ça change.      So put your shades on and enjoy the sun while you can, don't be afraid of it, It is life.            Disclaimer: All spans of time mentioned in this comment are approximate. I'm a historical enthusiast, not a time traveler.  	31	2
2018-04-04 19:53:04	Michael	What about the fact that humans speeding up climate change and helping the ing of the planet will cause the ice to melt faster hence adding more water into the world and hence speeding up what we saw in this video also this long parag you wrote, where did you find all of this information  	33	6
2018-04-02 22:31:51	FollowtheLucario	First: While ice grows in some parts, it melts in others. Second: The increase in the ice cap area happens because when glaciers melt, their water goes to the sea. Being less dense than marine water, it gos to the surface, where it ends up freezing again. So the thick glaciers are being replaced by thin floating ice layers, which explains how the area can grow and the volume decrease at the same time. And look at how fun, this was from the second Google result  	5	6
2018-04-02 13:18:23	Riddick Xavier	Your IQ is obviously low so I'll try and write simple.

2018-03-17 10:53:24	FollowtheLucario	The Earth has been ing for thousnads of years, it's not our fault. Well, you're right, interglacial periods last for _thousands_ of years. In the last two hundred years, the polar ice has melted more than during the whole Middle Ages. We are making a process that should take thousands of years to happen faster than nature, and even us, can adapt. And don't say we won't be around twelve thousand years from now. The _Homo_ genus has existed for some 2 million years and the _Homo sapiens_ alone for some 200 thousand.  	31	2

2018-02-27 02:47:10	A Nerd with a Switch	@funkydozer I think that man-made climate change is a thing, and it is happening, my main point of evidence being the time span that the Earth has ed up. Whereas it took the Earth an approximated 6,000 years for it to cool one degree Celsius, over the past two hundred years (the beginning of this time span coinciding with the industrial revolution), it has ed that same amount. In a geological time span, that is barely the blink of an eye, and average global temperatures have risen full degree.  	20	2

It would not be narcissistic to think so because narcissists think of themselves as better than anyone else and does no wrong. So wouldn't that mean that the people who believe that humans had 0 involvement in global ing be narcissistic? Also pollution contributes to over 90% to global ing. you can go on nasa and look at the facts yourself  	20	2
2017-12-02 22:03:05	Fangles	Past data indicates that the ing period has a little while to go before it starts to cool down again, and cool down it will. Too bad global ists don't bother trying to acknowledge said data and the science behind the motion of planets, but instead choose to revel in a man-made catastrophe just so they can feel smug in their belief that tre still the apex of universal life when they recycle a plastic bottle.  	20	2
2017-12-02 15:04:36	Silly Puppy	Who knows, we might have avoided the next glacial period. Some global ists are crying about that as if it's some great catastrophe. Oh no, we're safe from freezing, it's all our fault, panic panic.  	31	6
2017-11-13 20:29:48	Fangles	You mean Glacial Period, as we are still technically in the same ice age we entered 2 to 2.5 million years ago. We are due for the next cold snap in a few thousand years, right now we are still heating up, and it is NOT because of us. The delusion that Human Beings are special enough to be held entirely responsible for the climate change of a planet is narcissism to the extreme.  	20	2

2017-11-06 06:23:55	It'sMeBoldyB !	for the record, earth temperatures have acctually been skewed and we are getting colder not hotter, also earth always changes. we started as pangia and plates are constantly shifting, sea levels will always rise and fall as the plates shift, new zealand and png etc is all one plate and used to be above sea level its called 'zealandia' now all thats left is the 'tips' of the mountains - search tectonic plates for more info!!  	31	2
2018-04-02 21:02:10	Edin743	 Actually, we are going to enter a century long ice age around now, but I think it will be unnoticeable since the global ing will keep up with the ice age and we won't really notice any extreme changes untill next century, then. Ice caps will start to melt massively!  	31	6
2018-01-23 02:38:31	It'sMeBoldyB !	 thanks but 1. I can't say I'm 100% right and 2.

2018-01-21 09:23:06	It'sMeBoldyB !	 thanks I'm no scientist, I just like to learn about the world in which we live. Well it will fluctuate but overall it should hold at a constant, the equator is slighty closer to the sun (I no that we r tilted etc it's to do with rotation and angle etc) as heat rises and cold drops it could create new currents of wind which could change the heat/cold ratios and one could over power the other I guess which could push more heat to the poles and in turn more cold to the equator, being in the 'goldilocks zone' we should stay at a constant it's more to do with the magnetosphere and radiation. If our atmosphere is destroyed by bursts of radiation from the sun through solar flares, due to our magnetosphere not being able to handle a large earth facing solar flare then it would destroy our atmosphere and would fry the surface of the planet. Like mars, there's no or little atmosphere to stop radiation which in turn causes massive heat during the day and freezing temperatures at night because there's nothing holding in/blocking those temperatures. There's a lot of factors u need to take into account, if the Gulf Stream starts working properly again then we should be ok but it's a hard one to estimate. Thanks for the interest, i don't know everything and I'm probably wrong about some things but I present more theories and possibilities, u don't know what information has been skewed and new elements about science we r yet to fully understand, we used to think the earth was flat, science isn't always right or predictable but more a step towards more knowledge. Sorry I rambled and went off topic abit.  	31	2
2018-01-21 09:01:41	Fluffy Bear	 really? Hm nice explanation though! Hm if the equator is getting hotter and the poles are getting colder.... Then which one will vanish or remain The equator or the poles? Sorry that I ask but I love listening to interesting topics that caught my attention like your comment XD!  	5	6
2018-01-21 08:43:34	It'sMeBoldyB !	 ..... long story short, due to gulf streams the equator is getting hotter and the poles are getting colder due to less regulation of global temperatures  	20	2
2018-01-21 08:42:16	It'sMeBoldyB !	 the sun has an inner core and outer core, they react differently at different times, solar minimums and maximums, temperatures fluctuate on the planet due to different conditions and I heard the Gulf Stream isn't regulating temperature like it should (fresh and salt water ratios change how it works) so with multiple different factors we have hot periods and cold periods. Look at El Niño and La Niña for some more info, yes over a decade we may get a gradual rise in places but other places are getting more snow. In a few years we may fluctuate and get hotter but I've heard it's acctually getting colder, can't remember the source and also that's only over a 10-100 year period it's different when u look at it on a bigger scale. For example a volcano is almost going to go off within the next thousand years, with so many showing signs of activity, if that happens it will blanket the earth and cause an ice age, so this can change the weather drastically which then have other effects. I've heard that more ice is acctually forming around atleast one of the poles and the earth is acctually getting colder. Btw I also heard there are 4 ice breaker ships that produce more co2 then all or atleast most of the  globe put together(don't no if it's true) and also dinosaurs supposedly farted more co2 then we produce so even if the earth is ing it would be more to do with its relation ship with the suns radiation and the gulf streams and how they circulate temperature. Although the earth has been known to fluctuate many times through out its life. Sorry for the essay I hope this gives u some more information  	31	2
2018-01-21 07:49:46	Fluffy Bear	Oh really then why the hell in every year that passes on the city I live in gets hotter and hotter on summer?????!!!! it doesn't get colder!!! It's getting hotter and hotter help ;-;  	20	2
2018-01-21 05:22:32	It'sMeBoldyB !	's Gear review I agree because the ice is like 90% on or below the water line in a glass but if u have a massive amount of ice above sea level or if u have 'a heap of milo in a glass' (dirt) and ice cubes on top of that and that melts then it would rise and spill over the top of the glass because it would take the path of less resistance and due to it being in a container it could only go up due to it hitting the walls of the glass and would cover the milo (bad example because the milo would try to float but still) and same thing would apply to the earth it would melt down but and would spread but it couldn't really go wider because water raises together and therefore would rise.  	33	6
2018-01-17 00:56:45	It'sMeBoldyB !	Ftr 'climate change' is just another tax raiser, if they were so worried then they would implement a lot more free or sustainable, co2 free energy. But they don't, they just keep raising fuel costs and deplete our earths natural resources for money. Either they know and don't give a shit or it's false and they're just scamming people to get ahead.  	20	2
2018-01-17 00:51:28	It'sMeBoldyB !	 Girl I do agree but that's only from the 1920's. That's only a flicker of life compared to billions of years. Different changes to the sun can affect it depending on the suns state and activity. There's more to take into account, the affects of planetary bodies. The orbit of the earth and how other objects can influence that. The influence of the magnetosphere and our current atmosphere and the chemicals inside it. Also depending on ur source some science papers only take a few things into account and some have even been proven to be skewed to help companies turn a profit. Supposedly dinosaurs farted more green house gases then humans so 'climate change' could acctually be false too but I do get what u mean and I do agree. Gd info, I u have a video or link to watch or read I'd appreciate that.  	20	2
2018-01-17 00:40:23	Sofia Filardo	, also, where did you hear that temp is decreasing? I don't think that's true do a fact check pls  	20	2
2018-01-17 00:39:24	Sofia Filardo	 The stats show tempatures have been rising since the 1920s very significantly accoring to a CNN study. Every 20 yrs temp increases by 5 deg Celsius. Yoy have a Cool theory, but the stats don't match. But I do know that global ing translates to extreme weather patterns, meaning it does not necessarily mean cold/ hot weather, it can mean both if the weather patterns r both extreme. So I do know sometime the weather goes our of control at times, and it is BOILING then a day later it's FREEZING. That's technically global ing. So I can see why you would think that earth won't melt because of the constant change in weather. But at a certain point, there are so many harmful gasses that will prevent from things like snow to come, and the only time it will come is in rare insignificant spasms, when a bunch comes but immediately melts again.  	31	2
2018-01-17 00:35:28	It'sMeBoldyB !	And also what field of research does ur dad focus on?  	4	5
2018-01-17 00:34:49	It'sMeBoldyB !	 Girl I agree with u, I didn't mean to come across rude but once again evidence, get ur dad to give links and references. Btw people used to think the earth was flat. Science isn't always right it's a journey of understanding and piecing together where we r, where we come from and where we r headed. That's why we have theories. To debate how plausible each theory is, once we have evidence to disprove it then we can answer new questions and move forward, not everyone is at the same level of knowledge so once again, evidence please :)  	35	2
2018-01-17 00:29:52	Sofia Filardo	, d is a real scientist. Unlike you. don't say he not a scientist it's annoying. And he knows how to debate. He's not the one who's writing these comments so if you were to say that you would be referring to me not him. Also, your "theory" is in fact scientifically wrong. The earth can't cool at this stage. The gases are trapped and the ozon lait is breaking. Though your theory is very smart and I can tell your very intelligent. Also sorry I was a bish at first. I get mad when I disagree w peopld. I would be glad to debate tho, I actually love debating. I'm on my school debate team and everything.  	20	2
2018-01-17 00:29:18	It'sMeBoldyB !	Also, it's just abit of fun, in the end we r all just energy and reality is just what u perceive, remember a human eye can only see a minute bit of this universe so really everybody's 'experience' could all be different. Eg the colour red I see could be green to u but u call that red. We could perceive things differently. Gd luck to all on ur own journey to understand the life u live in. If any of u have any evidence of the things ur saying I'm wrong about I'd gladly like to have a look to better understand everyone's individual perception of reality. Btw once again I'm not saying I'm right it's just theories. Just understand that before u criticise others. Gd luck.  	19	5
2018-01-17 00:17:27	It'sMeBoldyB !	 Girl guys it was a theory! Not a belief it was a possibility. If ur dads a scientist and can't have a debate then he's not a real scientist. Also the earth does 'pulse' different weather patterns depending on the suns power, electromagnetic shielding etc. If u believe everything ur told then people would just accept things and we don't progress scientifically. It's a debate, it's a theory. Not fact, theory! I do sorta agree with u on the 'melting theory' but wat if we lose our atmosphere and we can't hold in those gases? Wat if a volcano erupts tho and shields us from the sun and we have a ice age, or atleast a mini One, extremely possible if u no how many volcanos r active. And me saying Pangea was the first was a loose example, I don't know exact names. I'm pretty sure Pangea is wat we will eventually turn into, we came from gawanda or something but that still may not have been our first 'face' of earth, but I don't see how people who believe Pangea was the first form like to have same sex relations. I'd just like to say, wow u people get so worked up, just theories just a disscussion , now all of u keep saying I'm wrong I haven't seen one bit of evidence or source. Fuck, if ur saying no scientist would agree with me then I wouldn't agree with them coz they obviously don't have enough comprehension to understand a theory or a debate and slightly makes me sad for that guys dad lol  	31	2
2018-01-16 21:06:01	Sofia Filardo	 Not 1 scientist agrees with you. I wonder why. I know many scientists, d is one. But he diagrees. Do research. I beg you. You seem smart, so don't waste your brain on this bs.  	37	2
2018-01-16 21:04:03	Sofia Filardo	 Ice ages form from huge volcanoes, not your dumb theory  	5	6

2018-01-16 21:02:28	Sofia Filardo	, don't try to be scientific when your not. There is  the earth is getting colder because all the gases r getting trapped in our atmosphere. Don't say that bs. The earth will melt. You seem smart, so I'm guessing your just misinformed. But please, do some research before spewing your propaganda.  	20	2

2017-12-28 00:54:42	It'sMeBoldyB !	Skits-o -Rama yea I do agree but it doesn't mean that's 100% true, now this is pretty out there, but still possible. I no u guys probably won't get this and just try to argue but: What if it was man made? Wat if it was a plan to divide, if climate change is real they could've used it to raise sea levels slowly and be able to blame it on nature. If people have less communication (eg I can't walk to Syria to find out for  or talk to people travelling from there because there's seas to cross or boarder etc) navies can use seas and rivers as ways to move forces quicker then civilians. (Evidence shows nuclear bombs existed in ancient times) so technically rising sea levels would be great for an agenda, long story short what if Zealanda was sunk to break up  and the surrounding islands. It creates smaller armies, smaller guerrilla factions and rebels, easier to watch. So yes I do agree with u but there's always the possibility something else could be true. They've seeded hurricanes, they can erupt volcanos, they line the atmosphere with aerosol sprays and they can create earthquakes (patents for all of these are available) so once again yes I do agree but that doesn't mean ur 100% right, even how out there my theory is it's just a theory.  	31	2

2017-11-25 02:31:14	It'sMeBoldyB !	or more importantly wat information have u brought to the table? im all up for a debate, i can admit when i am wrong, im always looking to further my knowledge, i just dont wanna waste my time if ur gonna be a little whiney   	19	5
2017-11-25 02:29:09	It'sMeBoldyB !	how is that a climate change deniers tactic? deniers have facts? isnt rising sea level wat climate change is all about? i mean i dont believe it considering its theorised that dinosaurs farted more co2 or we have 5 ice breakers or large ships that basically create the same co2 as all  around at this time or the fact the earth is getting cooler because the research saying its getting hotter has acctually been skewed (wont get into it now) or the fact the earth and the sun 'breathe' and become more powerful and weaker creating ices ages and droughts. did u have a bad day or something? i was just putting facts out. it is relevant because its talking about sea levels rising, i was just adding some facts its not like i was talking about this on the video of "why noni left play skool' or some crap. ill end this disscussion with this: every one has a right to their own beleifs, respect that and 2. fighting people on outube doesnt make our race any smarter, we r in it together, black, white, yellow, it doesnt matter we are all 1 race. the human race, help to advance it or be one of the many holding the scientific community back!  	20	2
2017-11-17 11:09:41	Bob Trenwith	That's right ... I didn't resort to the tactics of climate change deniers.  	20	2
2017-11-16 20:57:49	It'sMeBoldyB !	 its more to do with rising sea levels which I was just pointing out could be a number of reasons and that it happens all over different periods of time. But thanks for your input and treating the topic like an adult and not resorting to name calling or insulting others.  	31	2
2017-11-16 19:40:37	Bob Trenwith	So discussion of plate tectonics is irrelevant in relation to the current ing. Glad to have helped.  	35	2
2017-11-16 16:09:57	It'sMeBoldyB !	 I don't know exact numbers it's only minute though, like a few centimetres if that I'm more talking over millions of years timeframe and also it would be hard to measure unless you were a little more specific like which plate, which time frame etc... different plates can move at different rates due to different forces acting on it, earthquakes can cause almost instant volcanos but can also only cause very minute shifting as well. Hope I could help.  	35	2

When you have an ice cube sitting in a glass of water and it melts the water level doesn't rise it LOWERS. Frozen water is less dense than liquid water, therefore water takes up more  in it's frozen state. I guess the "Scientists" at Business Insiders didn't pay attention in school when that lesson was taught.

2017-10-23 12:26:12	Zenamo	The planet goes through natural cycles, and we are simply recovering from the previous ice age and the major one before even that, however humans are indeed accelerating this process unnaturally but it is indeed simply a cycle of the planet. You have reason to fear if you live in such places near the ocean or in china, and in many other areas affected, but this will not end our species, and we will persevere as we have in the past, from many ice ages, extinction events, etc. If you do fear our species extinction do not forget that technology is x1000 times greater than it was when our species survived the last ice age, and before that, and before that. Our world is an ever changing constant, nothing we do will stop this change, nothing we do will change the direction of our planets cycles, do not stress.  	31	2

2017-10-15 17:18:39	Akim Mika	easy save the land by creating giant lakes in dry up area. Such as in africa desert. Use solar panels to pump water daily for years. Turn it into canal, river, lake etc. Charge money to use the river like a toll. The ground should filter salt water into potable, cultivable water for vegetation or genetic modify plants to grow in harsh environments. More green less co2 and more food. It this work than the ice should form (build, store)itself back into the poles That should reverse global ing. Then when salt lake would become salt mines.   Only bad thing is that quick sands no joke.lol   Form use block sement and drop in spots, or sell the sand thats dug up to create the rivers and lakes. A lot cheaper and safer then walls. Cities can be created along the path of water.   Require world coaporation.  	11	2
2017-10-15 16:43:00	Tony Bell	Think about this: take a glass fill it with ice cubes, as many as you can fit, now fill the glass with water to the rim. Let the ice melt and see how much spills over the rim. Did it spill over? No, displacement is already in effect. Hence no ocean rise due to ice melt. Simple physics that the "so called scientists" fail to address. Wake up folks!  	5	6
2017-10-17 11:15:37	Bob Trenwith	Yes - hundreds of thousands of years ago evaporation from the sea combined with cold temperatures and resulted in precipitation that raised ice levels on land while simultaneously lowering sea levels. Now as that ice melts the old sea levels are being restored. So glad you understand now. Let me know if there is anything else you need explained.  	5	6

That's right you wont, give them some credit you cant even comprehend how difficult it would be to correctly calculate the actual submersion of the entire planet, did you know you would have to even calculate the precipitation and rainfall how it would affect body's of water to correctly calculate such a ridiculous thing? Of course you don't, you'd rather flame the video for making an estimation that you wouldn't take the time out of your day to recreate it better than it is.  	5	3

2017-09-28 19:28:35	Right to Record	Sorry, but you can't melt the ice on this planet. As soon as enough ice melts to alter the salinity of the oceans about 1% the thermodynamics powering the currents will be reduced to a point where the  equatorial waters no longer move to higher latitudes. That means the northern and southern climates become frigid, massive snowfall begins, and you plunge the planet into another ice age with huge portions covered by glaciers several miles thick. That increases the salinity of the oceans, eventually the currents become dynamic again to the point where enough heat is transferred to melt most of the ice, and that's why the planet constantly freezes up and thaws out but has never overheated. It's basic chemistry dictated by the difference between salt water and fresh water when heat is applied.  	31	6

2017-09-15 04:57:00	Robert Evans	This is a rather simplistic look at the volume of water liberated on an earth that is devoid of pliability. In fact, if the oceans water level rises, it puts more weight on the ocean floors and would likely push up the continents. Although some of the coasts may disappear, there are other coasts that may rise up and even grow. Science can be a great thing in the hands of great minds. Don't fall for simplistic models like these people are portraying.  	5	3

2018-02-05 20:36:42	SKYNET	Your right, I am estimating 50-100 years coastal will flood.  	31	3
2018-02-05 15:22:56	Bobbi Garcia	Night  it will take centuries sure. But Florida and other coastal cities are 50 to 100 years away from being 3 feet under water. Sure it's not a lot. But it's a lot to Miami.  	23	3
2018-02-05 07:13:59	Ben Geldzahler	just like so  	25	7
2018-01-30 02:14:46	SKYNET	 It will take centuries.  	18	1
2018-01-22 02:07:58	Bobbi Garcia	 Even though the flooding is still 50 years away people are going to start looking at in terms of how long it's going to take them to pay off the mortgage and the benefit at the end of paying off that mortgage. So yea it would be smart to start now that way you can get the maximum amount that your house is worth because in the next ten years people are going to be reminded that a 30 year loan on a Florida house is unrealistic.  	31	3

2017-09-10 03:35:10	William Gaines	Failed to account for increased cloud cover. All the water will not be on the earth at the same time. It won't occur overnight. If it takes 50 years adjustments/shifts of populations will occur as this happens.   Turning your lights off, or charging more to have them on will not reverse anything.   The earth is everchanging. Repeat, THE EARTH IS EVERCHANGING.  	31	2

If all of the ice melted on Earth... would be here to talk about it since the SUN would have killed us with the extreme heat. Secondly. Try this yourself. Fill a tall glass full of ICE. Then put room temperature water in the glass, to the rim. Watch what happens to the water. Let me know how it worked out for you. Then call Al Gore, and tell him to EAT YOUR SHORTS.  	31	6

2017-09-01 18:08:48	joanne j	The Earth could prepare for this.      The way scientists talk about all the ice melting, they talk as if the entire planet would be covered by water, but this, this is not as bad as they make out and they can prepare for it.      The real problem comes from the weather change from the massive amount of fresh water that will collude with the salt water. That is where and when the fun and games will start that will make sea water rise look like a Queen Anne T-Party.  	31	6
2019-02-05 11:25:06	joanne j	@ Yeah nightmare, but humans needed to put their dicks and fanny's away and stop populating like they have, lets face it mate. Sorry to have been blunt, but it is the truth. Men and woman keep adding to the Worlds population, they never learn so they will have to suffer the consequence, them and their unruly offspring. Simple.  	3	1
2017-09-03 18:06:12	IamTenzin	No. The real problem is the dislocation and inundation of all those population centers and loss of industry which lies primarily on the coasts. All those people uprooted, and forced to move will result in one of the greatest calamities that humanity could ever possibly face.  	1	3

2017-08-31 00:06:24	.	In fact we did not "learn last year that climate change is irreversible" as we have known for decades that planet Earth goes through am environmental cycle that lasts for millions of years where oceans rise and fall and the temperatures rise and fall and glaciers rise and fall.      The only thing that can be said here that has any basis in fact is that Humans have impacted this cycle just like every other creature to have lived on this planet in the history of ever, from millions of gigantic dinosaurs taking massive methane exuding shits, to  Whales with the runs creating brown liquid clouds 2 miles long.      Sure there are things we can and should be doing to reduce our needless impact but other than packing up and leaving the planet you all better get used to the fact that we are just a part of the history of this planet which will go on without us long after we islam, nuke, plague ourselves to death.      According to hippy morons we should already be living on a scorched planet by the turn of the century and 17 years on that is hardly even remotely the case, so I put it to you youtubers to have a healthy dose of scepticism when the hair heads come around with their doomsaying and their donation cap in hand wanting your tax dollars/pounds for "research" which we all know is a con for "the best weed and whores on the tax payer dime/penny"  	31	2

Hopefully the world will follow the lead of the US, Europe and (finally) China in lowering their footprint. Still, China is (by far) the major emitter - more than twice that of the US.The solution is not a ban on grilling, absurd rallies, less  or other nonsense but sweeping technological changes along with natural gas and renewables.  	5	2

Most of the books and documents in libraries were burned or destroyed by illiterate vandals (just as in Mali recently by ISIS). But some fragments survived   Around 1510, the sh admiral Pereis published a copy of a fragment of an earlier map. The map showed, hundreds of miles from the air, what the coast of   and Antarctica looked like! Most thought the Pereis map a fake UNTIL .. around 1980 US satellites used sonar to draw an accurate map of Anarctica land under the 1-2 mile deep ice!   The Pereis map was amazingly accurate   1 Ice HAS melted earlier from Antarctica (15000 BC? 100000 BC?) 2 Advanced civilizations existed that had satellites with cameras!  	31	2

2017-08-08 15:05:50	Ben Jacobs	Solutions:      1\. Build a wall around the current ice, or build a large container and fill it with water.   2\. Find a way to make it colder on Earth(possibly by releasing Sulphur dioxide into the atmosphere, search it up).   3\. Allow the ice to melt, build walls around large cities and expensive/Important facilities that would become underwater.   4\. Quite literally block some sunlight, who knows how.   5\. We actually stop global ing now, before it causes the sea level to rise to much, by using clean energy resources(which also happen to be renewable) and driving electric , and somehow stop the methane from livestock(I'd suggest not eating meat, or eating synthetic meat)!  	31	6

All the while, everyone who has even a passing knowledge of history knows the Greeks proved the Earth was round 2500 years ago, using simple trigonometry. Anyone with a cheap telescope can see that the other planets are all round. How fascinating that the human ego won't permit some to realize just how wrong tre. So... before you start with all the "ple" nonsense, and personal attacks (a sign of true weakness), take a few basic science classes.  	35	2

Come to your own conclusion and understand what NASA has to show for the amount of $ (BILLIONS) being taken from taxpayers is nothing short of pathetic and fraudulent.

2017-08-03 20:52:13	James Richardson	I am at a loss. What's the logic behind anyone trying to deny climate change (global ing)? Is the reason as simple as appears to be, that those people are taking that stance as a way to keep destroying the Earth without feeling guilty? I think this proves man can twist, bend and manipulate any fact to fit what he wants to be true. Before I go on I feel I should explain, when I said "Destroying the Earth" I meant destroying the Earth for us (or simply destroying us), as the Earth will eventually recover and be fine, that is once we have all died off, taking most of the other remaining species down with us (the ones man hadn't already killed off long before that is). This isn't exactly staying on topic but it is interesting none the less, If all the humans on Earth simply disappeared life on Earth would continue as is (better actually as the greatest threat to is and all the other species would be gone. Yet, if all the ants disappeared life as we know it would grind to a halt. I think that's incredible)      This below isn't near all of the available proof and explanations but it's a good, simple start.   1\. Though there are some records kept of temperatures going back to the 1650's, all inclusive and detailed records began in the early 20th century (a little over 100 years). So in those 100 years the 10 est years on record have all came since 1997, that should tell you alot. The odds of that being just random are very slight.   2\. One of the biggest points deniers like to focus on is based on their misconception of the term "Global Warming" and how it will eventually lead to colder temperatures. They like to say "if were really causing global ing then how will it lead to colder temps?". Thats where they shut off their minds, before hearing why... Here are two of the explanations that should further help them grasp the truth. The Arctic's temperatures are rising twice as fast as the rest of the globe, here's two reasons how that will lead to colder temperatures.   A. First off, as the polar ice caps continue to melt from Global Warming, it causes the oceans water level to rise, covering more land. If you don't see how even small rise in water level would affect us and the land take out a map and start looking, I mean really looking at how many places are barely above sea level as is. Land radiates heat, water absorbs it, so the less land there is to radiate and store the heat the colder the temperatures will become.   B. As I said the Arctic's temperatures have risen twice as fast as the rest of the World, and as that er air spreads down it pushes colder air down closer (as im sure you all know  air rises & and cold air is heavier and falls) leading to colder and colder temperatures.   Arctic—a region that has ed twice as fast as the rest of the world over the last two decades—creates a bulge of  air in the lower atmosphere that forces the jet stream to become wavier, coming down further south in some places and than peaking farther north in others then as it travels eastward around the Earth it dips further south into lower latitudes than it used to, carrying with it cold Arctic air.   C. One more thing they like to try and throw out there is..."If we are causing an Ice Age then why were there other Ice Ages before? Some even before man existed?" Once again this shows the usual lack of understanding, and lack of even attempting to understand. No one is saying ice ages havent happened before, there have been natural occurring ice ages, as the Earths tilt on it's axis shifts slighlty from time to time. Five times to be exact (that we know of and have proof of). But tre few and VERY FAR in between. This is happening much to soon, off cycle. Brought on early through the negligence of mankind.   Well, I hope this helps at least a couple of "deniers" understand better and be more informed. Though I doubt they will change their minds. As ive noticed from many arguments and debates Ive had on various subjects. When someone is in denial and lets their emotions affect their mind it doesn't matter how much undeniable evidence in front of them they'll find a way to make it fit their beliefs.  	31	2

When all the ice melts and turns to liquid water, you will see that nothing spills out!   If all the ice in the Arctic ( North Pole ) melted, no problem. The ice melting in  and Antarctica would be a problem due to the ice being on solid ground and not water.  	5	6

2017-07-25 11:06:59	Hannodb1961	This is just fear mongering bs. Most of the Arctic ice have already melted, and there is ticeable difference in sea level. Then compare how tiny Antarctica is compared with the enormous volume of the oceans, and I'm really having a hard time to believe the impact will be this big. Also, remember that Ice is less dense than liquid water, so the ice caps of Antarctica will actually take up _less_ volume than it does now. I'm sorry, but I just can't accept this on the authority of someone's say so. Science is suppose to be based on evidence, not doctrine.  	31	6
2017-08-14 06:57:08	Hannodb1961	I hear what you say  	25	7
2017-08-13 13:37:07	Hannodb1961	_But acting as a negative feedback, there will be more precipitation_ How is that negative? More precipitation would mean more plant growth, possibly even the greening of the desserts, which would mean that more Carbon dioxide is absorbed into the biosphere. More vegetation would also absorb more sunlight. All of that should serve to _reduce_ global ing. Anyway. I'm in  the best person to debate these issues, because I haven't made a serious study of it. I simply listen to the arguments and counter arguments, as well as what I see in my everyday life, and I am not convinced that we're headed for some kind of unprecedented global catastrophy. I'm betting that there will be no observable change in sea level in my life time, and I still have many more decades to live. That's my two cents.  	31	2
2017-08-13 12:57:38	Hannodb1961	I'm sorry, but I'm still not buying it. According to satellite information, most of the Ice in the North Pole has melted already, and yet we haven't seen any significant changes in sea level. This includes quite a lot of glacial ice as well. I've been going to the oceans every  for 38 years, and I haven't seen any noticeable difference at all. It's all good and well to run the numbers, but that assumes you have taken all the variables into account. For instance, if the world becomes er, it is also reasonable to accept that a greater amount of water will evaporate into the atmosphere. Unless I see some EMPIRICAL evidence of radical changes in Ocean levels, I will remain skeptical. Climates change. I get that - it is perfectly natural, and it has happened all the time. I simply do not believe it taking today's trends and simply assume they will continue for the next hundred years. I haven't seen any evidence yet that is cause for alarm.  	31	6
2017-08-13 09:25:05	Hannodb1961	Uhm yeah. So? What happens when I put an ice cube in a bucket? Will it fill the bucket when it melts? Ofcause not! now compare the volume of glacial ice with the size of the oceans. There is no comparison. And when that ice melts, it will take up even less volume, evenly distributed across the face of the entire planet. We're talking a few centimeters here at most - you won't even notice it.  	5	6
2017-08-13 03:30:26	Bob Trenwith	_"Ice is less dense than liquid water, so the ice caps of Antarctica will actually take up less volume than it does now"_ Glacial ice sits on *LAND* . It currently is not displacing *ANY* water.  	5	6

2017-11-18 19:56:07	Rubus den röde	+, I think it is very likely global ing is due to humans.

2017-09-22 02:11:05	Rick Salt	 , The US helped India with 300 coal power plants , China is the biggest polluters on the earth . Carbon tax = to collect $3Billion from Western Countries and redistribute that to " Developing Nations " which India and China are on that list . Do you really think wealth distribution is the solution to global ing . It has nothing to do with the earth's magnetic field weakening and the polls dancing all over the place . It has nothing to do with the sun's activities . If there's a thick layer of carbon covering the earth why is it that sun burn is so much more intense than it was 50 years ago ? One thing I believe , the world is overpopulated and this is the best solution to the problem . A big ol' reality check . Developing Nations , aka over populated shitholes , I know this because tll want to move to  or The US .  	20	2

Take a look Maldives, how come Maldives losing more and more their islands then? And later on, Maldives will be completely underwater. And even The Netherland will be in critical situation in the future... Now let's take a look what will happen, if you put so many materials into your bath tub (with full of water).

If electric  becomes popular, then their business will be doomed.. Simply, they take all the money from you by polluting the earth..

2017-07-24 05:34:48	Arend Wolbers	Fill up a glas with water right to the rim and put it in the fridge, let it stay there 24 H! What is happened with the water, ye right it froze solid, but look better, and you see that the water is come up above the rim! So water that freezes solid is getting bigger, they use this trick to break rocks in half. When ice slowly melts it gets lower.   The problem with ice that melts in spring is that it melts and breaks faster than it build-up whole winter, sea water becomes steam, water clouds and comes down al snow, it partly melts and freezes again layer up on layer, if in springtime ice would melt as fast as it froze whole winter you would not have those icy rivers destructing bridges etc.   So as all ice on the planet melts slowly over 4-500 year period the oceans will perhaps rise 5 cm because of land ice of ages old. All ice on the planet will only melt within decades if temperature rises all over the planet to 25 degrees, even than it would never rise the oceans with meters, only with cm, every year the north-pole freezes solid and thaws in spring/summer, never notice sea level rise and fall!  	31	6

2017-07-24 04:27:53	Brad Fregger	I want to know what the earth will look like if volcanos block the sun's rays and we experience a nuclear winter. Or, how about a massive asteroid crashes into the earth, or the sun sends out a massive disturbance that shuts down all electronics and planes fall from the sky. All of these are more likely than all if the ice melting. You scientists are ignorant sky is falling jokes.  	31	6

We can make a huge difference.      Let's reduce global ing by limiting fossil fuels we pollute into our planet earth., who's with me. Let's do this before it's too late for the ice caps to melt competeley, and some americans cities will be underwater.

2017-07-20 17:08:53	David Smith	This is so much BULL I'm surprised the cows aren't rolling on the ground laughing. In order to melt the polar ice caps you would have to increase equatorial temperatures by over 25 degrees Fahrenheit. The resulting calamity would kill every living thing on the planet long before the seas started to rise. Even if humans managed to survive the planet would be a hot house for hundreds of years and then rapidly roll into an ice age.   But like I said, Never gonna happen. Global Cooling didn't sell, Global Warming didn't sell, Climate Change is just another way of saying "I don't know a damn thing about the weather".  	31	6

2017-07-19 14:22:36	Rod Martin, Jr.	BI Science, wrong! You say in the description that the sea levels have been rising at a greater rate year after year. Every chart I've seen from NOAA and NASA shows a relatively steady rate of rise. Zero acceleration. Here's one dataset from NASA:            Another chart, from NOAA, shows a significant slow-down compared to 2000 to 2005.            We live in an Ice Age interglacial. Glacial periods are deadly, and ing from the midst of one is a life-affirming event that comes unavoidably with lots of sea level rise. Humanity has lived with over 400 feet of sea level rise since the depths of the most recent glacial period of the current Ice Age.      Climate always changes. We could have more global cooling, kill off 7+ billion humans and trillions of animals, saving that precious coastal real estate, or we could suffer the balmy th of more global ing, melt all the damn polar ice, help people like me move from the coasts and save most everyone from certain death. Looks like you guys prefer to save coastal real estate instead of lives. Tsk, tsk.  	31	2

And with that map in mind, and with the idea that humans tend to live on coasts or along waterways, one can see why 'great flood' myths and Atlantian stories are prevalent across all cultures.

2017-07-13 17:01:35	Ephraim Gates	None of the ice currently floating in the oceans will have any effect whatsoever on the sea level if it all melted. Only the ice on top of Antarctica, or other land masses, will change sea levels and even then, I don't believe it would be all that dramatic. This means that all the ice on the North Pole could melt and there would be no change in sea levels at all, because floating ice already has displaced the volume of water equal to the mass of the ice.  	5	6

2017-07-09 00:13:05	Michael meh	Much of the ice on earth is supported by land, and would increase ocean volume if it melted. For example, in antarctica the ice is a mile thick but there's a continent of land under it, above current sea level. Also, you didn't even actually explain about the glass of icewater, you just wrote a sentence that sounded like an explanation in style, but had no explanatory content. The ice displaces a volume equivalent to its own weight in water, the part above the water is how much bigger than water a piece of ice the same weight is, and when ice melts it shrinks slightly by an amount precisely equal to the volume that was above the water. I'd hazard a guess you're completely ignorant about science and just believe anything that flatters your politics. That approach does not work reliably when dealing with matters of material fact. It is more often wrong than right. Politics is the product of human thoughts, feelings and imagination. Nature does not give a fuck about your politics. It is what it is regardless of whether you believe it.  	5	6

Next time you are near a globe compare the polar ice caps to the Pacific Ocean. The world is not going to drown. 60 meters! There isn't enough ice on earth to raise see level nearly 200 feet. 2 feet? Perhaps. 60 meters? No!  	5	6
2017-08-13 04:25:15	Bob Trenwith	Just looking at Antarctica: The Antarctic ice t covers 14 million square kilometres and its average thickness is 1.9 kilometres. That makes 26.5 million cubic kilometres of ice on Antarctica. The surface area of the world's oceans is 350 million square kilometres. Divide volume by area to get height, and you get 0.076 km. That is 76 metres. So it seems that 70 metres is actually an *UNDER* estimate. And we haven't even counted the other ice ts, nore allowed for *thermal expansion* of water. You never considered the *THICKNESS* of glacial ice, did you?  	5	6
2017-06-27 02:40:23	Angelo Jamaica	I would not worry about the fact that if all the ice melted, What would be more interesting is what the world would look like if there was another flood like in the days of Noah. so I can tell you honestly what it would look like, ONE BIG BLUE MARBLE OF WATER.

2017-06-26 10:37:36	Grumpy OldMan	If the ice floating in your margarita glass causes it to overflow when it melts, then I'll consider the possibility that sea levels might rise this much. I just don't think that there is enough of an ice pack currently sitting on land to have this sort of effect.  	5	6
2017-08-13 05:45:25	Grumpy OldMan	I haven't checked your figures, but the issue with that figure would be whether that amount of ice is sitting on land or floating in the water. Any of it floating in the water will cause NO rise of the sea level. Any of it sliding from land into the water, melting, and then being redeposited back onto land in the form of snow would also result in NO rise of the sea level.  	5	6
2017-08-13 04:27:16	Bob Trenwith	There is 26.5 million cubic kilometres of ice sitting just on Antarctica. When you spread that out over the 350 million square kilometres of ocean, how much of a rise do you think you get?  	5	6

Ours is at one of the lowest levels since the last great extinction(not including the dino- killing meteor)  	20	2
2017-06-24 13:10:49	Ron Mexico	They should show Earth 12,000 years ago. Lots more land. 12,000 years ago Man starting driving SUV's and man caused the Ice Age to end and flooded all the Great Cities and sent them into the  Age. It took 12,000 years to get back to driving SUV's. Man oh man did you see how much the Ocean's have risen since 1900? New York was 70 miles from the Ocean in 1900, and the Statue of Liberty could only be seen after a 5 hour train ride inland. No way we adapt, . lol  	31	2

2017-08-13 14:50:29	Ron Mexico	Sea Levels were 450 feet lower 20,000 years ago. England was still connected to mainland Europe in 7000 BC. It's just too bad prehistoric man was driving around in SUV's without a care in the world and caused the Ice Age to end and the waters to rise 450 feet. 125,000 years ago Sea Levels were 20 feet HIGHER than tre today, current day Miami was under water. Those old time Humans must have only been getting 2 mpg in their SUV's 125,000 years ago to have Sea Levels 20 feet higher than tre now. Adaption is obviously impossible, all the polar bears will die like they did 125,000 years ago.  	31	2

The Liberals in NYC will just move to other states, which could very well benefit the Democratic party. All in all, though, it will just hurt  as a whole, by ruining businesses, not to mention, many millions of dollars will be wasted on the buildings that would be underwater.  	1	1

2017-06-23 06:13:20	lornaduwn	Just in case you're thinking you'd end up with some prime beachfront property...National Geogic states: There are more than five million cubic miles of ice on Earth, and some scientists say it would take more than 5,000 years to melt      This rendition of the ice melt is quite inaccurate as it does not take into account the redistribution of water weight and the rise of land masses in compensation. Some places that are now underwater or lowlands would be lifted up, lessening the impact of flooding in those areas and thus increasing the flooding in others.      Another problem with this rendition is that the foliage coverage does not reflect any change. Without the cooling ice caps there would be less fluctuation in temperature from equator to pole. Seasonal weather would also be less fluctuating. The earth would have an average temperature of 80 degrees, with the er equatorial area creating evaporation that would fall as fresh rain on areas that currently are dry.      I will not be here in 5000 years, but I'm thinking it might be nice. I envision once dry deserts producing fruits and wildlife; rainwater fresh streams and rivers; and land that is green and sustainable well into the now barren polar regions.      Sounds like paradise to me.  	31	6

2017-10-11 16:47:01	cory in the house	 Sherwood my dude i know there are glaziers in the northern hemisphere because I drive past a massive one called “folkefonna” every few weeks. We are currently in an ice age because an ice age is defined as there simply being permanent ice on earth. And I know we are heading out of one now and that it’s going to make life rather difficult for countries like Denmark and the Netherlands. However I do not believe it will be the end of human civilization. Humans are the most innovative creatures this planet has ever seen. We went from using stone tools to automated robots in less than 15,000 years. And it really triggers me when people compare us with other animals saying we will last a few million years and then go extinct. We are able to predict what’s going to happens and adapt really quickly. We already live in every environment here on earth and by the 2030s we may live in environment that don’t exist here on earth like mars or the moon. A bit of water here and there isn’t going to be a problem unless you live in Denmark or the Maldives.  	31	6
2017-09-26 22:55:36	Chris Sherwood	you really need to check your facts, 1 there are MOST definitely glaciers in the northern hemisphere between ice ages, unless we are still in one. 2 ice ages are not like hockey rinks where you flood them then they freeze, its more like a crawl across the landscape as the snow accumulates into massive glaciers the weight forcing them to move and push the detritus across the landscape, this is how we know places such as cypress hills have never been covered by glaciers. 3 the ice ages are usually predicated by an event or series of events such as Super volcanoes erupting. Recessions, well they figure the last ice age would not have ended if something didnt smash apart the ice in the pacific. 4. mass extinctions usually follow these kind of events, and if you heed what scientists are saying (please note that these individuals have much more training than the average layman in these kind of matters) we are headed into another mass extinction event. This one by our own engineering, and humans are definitely not safe from other humans.  	31	6

2017-09-17 11:59:33	Vote With Bullets	We are seeing the recession of an ice age. We have seen this event no less than ten times since we started walking upright. Geologically, we know this flooding will happen. In between ice-ages, there are no glaciers in the northern hemisphere. Yes, flooding is extreme. And, in 100,000 years when the cycle comes back around, that flooding will freeze into ts of ice, covering most of the northern hemisphere. Then it melts again. We have walked on to legs for 2,500,000, years. Ice ages follow a cycle of about 100,000 years. Since we stood upright, we have seen this event happen no less than ten times. We survived those ... we will survive this.  	31	6
2017-09-13 13:15:55	Mr. Braddock	Fair enough, but how can you make out such detail? It's looks a bit of a rough estimate. It looks like where I live is affected at 80m above sea level, so I think that's unlikely, but it's difficult to tell from this rough presentation.  	5	3
2017-09-13 10:49:02	cory in the house	yeah dude center of the country there's a massive lake. ik that shouldn't flood since i drive over there every few weeks. and it's about a thousand meters above sea level. and Vestfold in the oslo fjord which is super lowland is all intact  	5	3

If you think the military would ever take the side of illiberals in a political class war, you need to neck yourself. Secondly, in case you don't realize, Republicans control the political landscape.

2017-09-18 01:52:11	Zefram Cochrane	Luis Velez My Uncle is a Canadian Forces Soldier and he'd put you in your place. That's not even talking about Canadian Joint Task Force 2. I'd never speak ill of 's boys, but you sir, I speak for all our men overseas when I proudly say you can go fuck yourself. Also all your Las Vegas water comes from us so if we tainted we could just end half of the States right there.  	24	0

2017-09-18 01:28:32	Zefram Cochrane	son hies ern ...ern Ontario is basically New York (Toronto), so I assume you mean the Prairies which, based on Superman, yeah, all farmland and oil fields. Let your dog loose you can watch him run to the horizon for 30 kms. So...New York is...Toronto? Huh, my friend I believe we just became allies...based on mutual hatred, isn't that nice? And I guess...Vancouver is...LA? And Niagara is...Las Vegas? Edmonton/Calgary is...San Francisco? And Ottawa (National Capital, Parliament) is...DC? Wow, we're actually not so different. Come, lets mutually hate our other national cities together.  	2	0
2017-09-18 01:25:14	Jackson Matthies	 I don't really like the north east and I am from Minnesota which is practically southern  but New York has a stereotype for being rude it isn't the whole country come to the upper Midwest the people r much nicer  	34	0
2017-09-18 01:20:30	Zefram Cochrane	son hies I've been to New York one time (furthest  I've gone in ) and all I got was "how's it goin', eh?" and "seen any moose aboot the hoose?" and though I laughed along and smiled because hey, we're Canadian and we gotta be the good guys, after each fucking joke I wanted to punch someone. Also I've seen  Park.  	38	5

2017-09-18 00:49:19	Zefram Cochrane	Okay Fucking SJWs , take a joke, like we're really gonna invade the States. But while we're at it, spending $600 million on military does not equal strength, quite the opposite in fact. And whoever the fucker was that called my nation punk, I got one ...TRUMP. Good luck . It's a fucking JOKE. What, do ns not know how to take jokes now?? Jesus, you make fun of my nation all the time. 's the ass-end down .  	8	5

2017-06-09 08:17:20	Welsh73&77	Using this theory, if you put 10 ice cubes into a pint glass and fill it with water. When the ice melts it should over flow. It doesn't, so why would there be mass flooding if the ice melted? Not that it will anyway, as the climate goes in cycles and we are in the cycle that will take us into a mini ice-age. That is why the Ice is actually thicker now than in previous years. Look up climategate and also look up why the founder of Greenpeace left his organisation. Also look up Piers Coburn too. It will lead you on a path of enlightenment. Brainwashed won't bother as they have switched off their minds to alternative theories and Global Warming then Climate Change is like a religion to them. It gives them a sense of purpose and they feel important - their quest to save the world. Carbon Dioxide is plant food - fact!   If we go to a zero level of Carbon dioxide then plants will not be able to go through the process of photosynthesis. Then everyone on Earth will starve. Taxing people on fuel causes fuel poverty and this is killing thousands every year. In UK IN JUST 3 WINTER MONTHS 43,000 FUEL POVERTY RELATED DEATHS WERE RECORDED. The rich like Bill Gates  Branson etc preach about "climate change" while jetting around the world in their private jets. It's all one big fat lie to tax people and reduce the population!  	31	6

2017-06-06 04:52:24	daimyo2k	This video is correct, only if the all the ice melted at one time and dumped into the ocean.      What's not taken into consideration when these studies are done is that...      #1... any water laden ice displaces itself. Example, put an ice cube in water, when the ice melts you will notice the water level does not rise... and yes, this is scalable to world size.#2... Any land laded ice is pressing down on the earth with a large amount of force. The crust of the earth being flexible and in a sense the land masses are floating on the mantle. As the ice slowly melt, and the pressure on the land mass relaxes, the land mass starts to "float" back up to it's original position replacing the water area that the ice-water is displacing (I think I got that right?). Example... take a piece of styro-foam and place it in some water, now put a piece of ice on it. The ice pushes down on the foam. As the ice melts, the foam rises from the water and the ice-melt moves to the water, the water level does not rise, everything is balanced out.      All this flooding is nothing more than a scare tactic. Even though "scientists" say the water levels have rise, there is actually no proof that it has,. Shore erosion may give the illusion that the sea level is rising, but there is no quantifiable evidence that it has..  	31	6

2017-06-05 02:09:04	hoschythekill	watch climate history and stop screaming ... and i talk about valid real data and not that hysterical models.      watch co2 levels in last thousands and millions of years, and then get rid of that "human/co2 based climatic change" thing.      let's talk about non national banks creating "money" out of nothing, compound interest and how it will allways drive the money from "poor" to "rich". or we can talk about so much important stuff, based on facts ... not on models who get desgined to fit whatever they needs to fit.      as long as i know, if the co2 level would have decreased the same amount that it has increased about last 400 years. mostly all "life" would have vanished from this planet. plants grow best at around 5times the co2 level then we have now.      i am open for any FACTS you can present me, but i talk about REAL DATA ... no data's from computer models.      we should take a lot more care of our "nature" ... for sure. but to do it harshly with wrong reasons is also no smart way. as long as "money" directs the way, we allways will follow the wrong direction.  	20	2

2017-06-04 12:55:26	Die ziy	I think its funny. people trying to stop this from happening, "Oh we need to save the earth!" please... this is the earth you just don't like change. the earth has been through this countless times. its a cycle. back in the day the Arctic would have normal days of 80+ degrees, so yeah where we live would get hotter. think about it. the coldest places on planets is the bottom and the top, if it gets 80+ on the top. imagine how hot it would get in the central regions. its fucking basic history. the earth doesn't keep a look. it changes, we are in the time of the earth... 'Trying new makeup' as you could say. most of these people are afraid of change. They want to talk science yet they claim there are "More than 2 gender's" and they back it up saying "We are on a spectrum, We are people who think freely" Science Is facts, it doesn't change because it doesn't make you happy or makes you offended. If you are in a room and the only door way is blocked by bricks to get out, "well i don't like the fact i'm trap" in here, make me on edge and uncomfortable so therefore its not there." when the room is flooding and you are in there, guess what! IT'S THE FUCKING WALL! but wait! "I said the wall isn't there" \- opinion, Fact's - "Hmmm maybe because the wall doesn't go when you don't like it." the earth is returning to its normal state, before the last ice age. makes the most since to me. yes are we speeding up the process? yes. can we 'Fix it'? no. we are just slowing the rate how how fast the ice will melt.  	31	2
2017-09-04 13:53:05	GamingTheSystems	Climate change is natural is something people tell themselves when they want to ignore the large problem. 7 Billion people on Earth is a new development as far as Earth's history, and so is the mass release of CO2 caused by their activities. Time to grow a pair and address the issue.  	20	2
2017-09-03 14:41:00	DAPTXDC4869	I'm not too worried about climate change. I know that it is a historic pattern the Earth inevitably repeats. But I am worried about pollution: Human beings really need to learn to live without "better living through chemistry" and petro.

2017-07-27 18:04:58	Cory Foster	Yes, the earth has been bombarded by , had major floods... went through extreme heat/cold but it always heals itself, it's simply what it does. While the earth will obviously be fine the real question is... Will HUMANS survive? We are essentially a parasite to the Earth. We have recently entered into an epoch called the Anthropocene (still are debates as to what it should be called.. when we entered it, etc.) It's pretty much based on the different effects humans have on the earth. In our current state, it doesn't look to good. We are certainty NOT moving towards a sustainable future. Issues like: Pollution (air, water, soil), Overpopulation, Public health, waste, economic irresponsibility, labor conditions, corruptions/violence, poor agricultural/irrigation, damage to biodiversity.. and many more are all contributing to major issues of sustainability that need to be addressed. So for the first time, the question of whether humans will survive (for year to come) has come into question. Whether through unsuitability (many factors of climate change) or nuclear war.. it seems despite our advancements in technology, we created our own demise. It's also a shame that none of these things receive much attention in news headlines, politics, etc.. when tre the most important (again, part of another problem: politics) Carbon dioxide level have permanently moved beyond 400ppm (the tipping point). The last time the earth had this level was about 3 million years ago.....If continuing to increase this will affect a number of things such as the Coral Reefs (most likely will die). Basically if you want to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilization developed and to which life on Earth is adapted… CO2 will need to be reduced. So overall I agree with you about the earth and yes, science does need to be questioned. But we as humans DO have the power to do something about all of this.. that's very obvious. We certainty are speeding up the process and you must realize that w/ that melting ice comes many other factors (er temperatures) that affect many other things around the world that will not be sustainable. So to say we are simply returning to the Earths normal state (which what exactly do you mean?) is fine.. but what do HUMANS do about it? Are you saying we are all doomed regardless? Like I said earlier, we are in fact creating our own demise whether it be through Climate change, nuclear war, etc... but things can be done about it.  	31	2
2017-07-26 01:38:08	aT x Conqueror	Yeah sure, but the rate that Earth had climate change before was fine because the fauna and flora had time to adapt, with the rate that we are speeding the process up by animals won't have enough time to adapt and evolve, therefore, wiping life from Earth.  	3	2
2017-07-25 20:10:23	I agree with you, but—	everyone knows we cant stop it or fix it at the moment, what people are trying to do is slow it down or find a way to fix it, also don't bring up "people are afraid of change" that's like what dictators said to people when they disapproved something, and whenever a statement like that is brought up its most of the time invalid since there is just not "people" there is millions of humans with different thoughts and opinions and views and its hard to say anyone is right or false.  	20	2

Covering 361.9 million sq mi of ocean would raise sea level 77 ft if you don't factor in the slope of the land, which means that the actual rise would be significantly less than 77 ft due to most land next to the coastlines in the world is at a very shallow angle, so roughly 15-20 ft is more realistic. This assumes that all ice melt drains into the oceans and is not trapped in lakes, or kept as ground water, plus the ice that is floating on the ocean already wouldn't effect sea level at all, so 216 ft is just plain silly.  	5	6

2018-09-02 21:34:30	Mentally Ill Dark Jeroid	This is what happens when the poles shift and the earth tilts to a new axis, the ice that has collected at the current poles will melt and gradually reform at the new poles. So Antarctica might be a nicer place to live if the poles shifted. I for one could use a giant inland sea in the Central Valley of California. It would likely help reduce the desert in ern California as rains might form off that inland sea. I don't see any negatives to this. People should buy up my "Impact" and "Dance of Death"  er novels on Amazon so I can afford to move out of the desert into a forested area instead of waiting for a pole shift or climate change or whatever to gain a forest where I live.  	31	6

2017-07-30 07:07:22	SealTheEggOmelet	 CA was also on fire a couple years ago because it gets very dry when the Santa Ana winds come through each year, just because it floods a bit at the beginning of each year doesn't mean it's not dry most of the time. We're out of the drought now anyways, and plus,  in CA really says it's the end of the world when it gets dry...we tend to only say that when it *ahem* FLOODS  	29	3
2017-07-30 06:36:36	Leigh Ann Tyler	Good lord... CA was FLOODING just a couple years ago!! Now, we're back to the end of the world cause CA is drying out? What a bunch of maniacs.  	29	3
2017-07-24 23:43:27	SealTheEggOmelet	Gabagel K I know, I live in CA, we had tornado warnings. But a lot of rain at the start of the year doesn't mean a drought is coming to an end as long as it's under the yearly norm. Which is why they didn't say it ended until the year ended, because while the storm at the beginning wasn't quite enough, the rest of the rain later on topped it off. So NOW we are out of the drought, barely, hence the raised water tax.  	31	3
2017-07-24 23:18:09	gabagel	last year during the winter time california got tons of water. the dams and reservoirs were filled to the brim. even one dam cracked open because of too much water.

It's been debunked by numerous scientists who have simply done the math on the amount of ice versus the mass of the oceans. Keep in mind, the oceans make up over 139 million square miles.   7 million cubic feet of ice on earth, if it all melted, would span out over the 139 million miles of ocean.   The math, which cannot be debunked, says that the oceans would rise by 17 inches.   Sleep tight, coastal cities. You are safe.  	31	6

2017-06-01 22:36:19	THURROCK VARMINTING	This is pure pseudoscience.   There is no facts in climate change.   The models that predict the effects of so called climate change are incomplete.   There are far to many variables not factored into these predictive models therefore the data is incomplete.  	20	2
2017-06-01 22:32:50	THURROCK VARMINTING	A common sense statement.   Please correct me if wrong.   The ice weighs equal to the amount of water contained within the ice.   Therefore The ice would displace the ocean making it appear to rise.   Much like putting ice cubes in a glass of water, then waiting for the ice to melt.   When sea water freezes the salt purges from the water making the ice have a lower salt content.   The salt from the ice sinks into the ocean making the oceans salt content slightly higher.   Would this extra salt have any affect on the displacement of water by ice?  	5	6

At that rate, it will take 926,829,268.293 years for  to become ice free. Bump that loss to 500 billion tons per year = 532,000,000 years to be ice free. Bump it to one trillion tons = 266,000,000 years to be ice free. 500 trillion tons lost/yr = 532,000 years. How many ice ages will we have in between?  	5	6

2017-05-29 16:14:45	Colin MacKenzie	This map shows something greater than 1 meter rise, more like the maximum if all ice melted, said to be about 67 meters, about 220 feet. At 220 ft, most of the west coast of the US would barely change, as the shores are generally pretty steep, except...much of California's Central Valley would be flooded. Sacramento would be completely flooded. Think of Fresno with beachfront property. Los Angeles would lose about a fifth of its territory. in WA, Puget sound would grow, though, again, high relief would limit land losses. The big shock would be Arizona with a coastline. The Gulf of California would stretch far to the north. In CA, almost to Palm Springs, in AZ, far up the Colorado River, flooding all of Yuma, and on well above Imperial Reservoir, and up the Gila River to Wellton.  	31	6

" what people neglect to include in a lot of research is how far land masses have moved over this same period of time.. The amount of Ice caps that are left will in  bring the sea level up 200 to 300 ft, are you out of your mind? just think a moment, how much ice has melted thus far and where the sea lvl is" there is not even a third of the ice that has melted left....its bullshit, ice has so much air inside it that the amount of water they predict will cover the earth is just bull, everything thing in our past is and has been guessed, there is nothing to prove anyone's point about anything they lay claim to for our past....This claim is right up there with the flat earther's....I'll wait for real science to come along and not some political bullshit for the next money making scam that is headed our way, and trust me; there is one right around the .....  	31	2

2017-05-25 02:31:00	2000toinfinity	"We learned last year that many of the effects of climate change are irreversible" That is false. The oceans were once much higher than tre now, because there were no ice caps on Earth at various times in the past. Just like the oceans were once much lower than tre now, during ice ages. Earth's climate changes in cycles. There are numerous ancient cities and settlements under hundreds of feet of ocean right now. It's what happens as climate fluctuates over the the long term.  	20	2

If people went extinct then all industrial activity would cease, no more putting greenhouse gases in the air, the gases that are left would eventually be filtered out/purified by plants, like the ones that turn CO2 into 02, and it would return to pre-industrial levels.  	31	2

2017-05-13 04:13:08	Gerry C	What a BS animation. Ice is crystallized water and floats because it is less dense. Ice displaces water via buoyancy to float. Take a measuring glass put in a bunch of Ice, Fill it up with water until all the ice cubes are floating and you get to a measurable level say 2 cup. comeback later when all the ice is melted and the water level will still be 2 cups. Every year the Ice of the north pole melts in summer and there is no rise in the water levels. In fact the water levels only rose when the Ice Age ended because we had 2 miles of Ice Sheets covering 75% of the surface area of the planet, that 2 miles only accounted for 400 feet of rising. Current Ice existing on the landmass during summer is about 2% covered and no more than a few feet in depth, which in proportion would only be a couple of inches, not even remotely close to the variation in high tide vs low tide.  	31	6

Not only would it have to be quite  to melt all the ice in the first place, the drop in albedo would increase the Earth's temperature even further.   If the Earth's temperature rises 10 C  will want to live on the (new) coasts, everyone will have to move to elevation. Saharan Africa will be a wasteland and I assume the equator will be an inferno.

2017-05-06 21:19:55	Andrew Creelman	Climate change is irreversible because it will never be stopped. No matter what we do to control it, the earth will continue to  and cool just like it has for billions of years.  	20	2
2017-07-17 20:00:56	Sam L	The Earth has obviously gone through many, many different phases of climate, but the changes have happened over the course of thousands of years. For example, cyanobacteria began producing oxygen as a waste product billions of years ago through photosynthesis; however, oxygen was essentially poisonous for most life back then, and as the O2 content slowly (key  being SLOWLY) built up over thousands of years, some life was able to evolve and use oxygen to their advantage, which led to the evolution of thousands of different species that use oxygen to breathe today. Some of the species that couldn't adapt migrated to areas of the planet with low amounts of oxgyen (the bottom of the ocean), and their descendants still live on to this day. The point I'm trying to make with this is that a massive change occurred in the Earth's atmosphere (which later affected climate, etc), and it was devastating to many species; however, because the change happened over a very long period of time, several were able to adapt and even thrive in this environment. The change that we're seeing over the past two centuries ago is NOT gradual; CO2 levels are changing faster right now than most (if not all) known atmospheric changes over the course of Earth's several billion year-old history, because our species has been pumping it into our air and our oceans. Life simply cannot adapt fast enough. Does this mean that humans will be responsible for the extinction of all life? I doubt it. However, there are countless forms of life that are going to needlessly die because of our greed, and who knows what this will do to to ecosystems around the world.  	31	2

2017-05-04 03:46:52	Tom Valle	Good to see all you are doing to inform the pubic of this universal problem.   I have a question related to rising sea levels and using solar / wind / wave energy not for private or commercial use but as an international ative.   As far as rising sea levels, many suggest reinforcing coastal areas with artificial seawalls. Instead of building sea walls, build massive pumping stations powered by wave energy to bring water inland to deserts (Sahara, North Africa to begin with), desalinization plants powered by solar energy, and there allow for deserts to become gardens (Psalm 107:35). I must be wrong somewhere in this scheme as it hasn’t happened or even been mentioned yet. If rising sea levels is even a possible issue, international ation should invest in a solution, much like Roosevelt’s New Deal era.   My question is would the Sahara desert be a suitable location, or rather the coast of North Africa, for building wave, solar, and wind energy stations capable of powering desalinization plants and water pumping stations and inland conduits?   Other areas might be  with a large inland desert.   Possible problems might include damaging local maritime habitat.   Any suggestions or possible political action?   Kind of a comment to DJ420, "everybody get drinking", the problem with the above solution would be simply displacing the water in a liquid form. If it would remain inland without returning quickly to the hydrological cycle, there would be a gain in this investment. Regardless, there are plenty of desert areas, even in inland China which has empty "ghost cities", that would benefit from increased amounts of fresh water.  	11	3

2017-05-02 03:48:06	Palmer Granite	Climate Change Could Be A Potential Blessing   The planet has been re-terraformed, get used to it. Mankind has the opportunity to evolve it's culture to fit into a more energetic environment. As atmospheric chemistry changes, other climactic factors react. The whole system feeds on itself to increase the energy absorbed by the planet and redistribute it through oceanic and atmospheric circulations until a new equilibrium is established. The Earth is going to become much bluer and greener. More wind, more rain, more th........sounds like a “greenhouse”.   What will happen in this greenhouse?   1) Increased natural energy sources for harvest: wind, wave, tidal, hydroelectric, biologic   2) Improved plant growth for: food, shelter, chemical fuel, waste remediation   3) Increased arable land area for food production, urbanization, and recreation   4) Increased ocean surface area and temperature expands oceanic food chain   5) More fresh water for consumption, farming, hydroelectric, recreation, transportation   6) Increased continental shelf area expands potential for controlled aquaculture   7) Increased cloud cover buffers thermal variations   8) Expanded atmosphere increases protection from ultraviolet   For half a century man has been seriously considering the problems of colonizing other planets. Ironically, mankind is now being transported to a different planet, and taking along the entire terrestrial living organism. The question becomes, are we smart enough to coexist with this more energetic environment. Do we “battle” nature to maintain the status quo (that's how we got to this transition)? Or should we reassess our capabilities and needs, and adapt to “harmonize” with the “New Mother Earth”?  	31	2

2017-04-30 11:53:31	JohnDoe	Flashy, overstated propaganda from the Globalists designed to get the weak minded to start hyperventilating and marching in the streets. Even the most zealous environmental scientists admit it would take at least 5000 years to melt all the ice. By then there will be  elevators that will have siphoned excess sea water into  - or some other solution we havent thought of. What really is at play here is the Globalists see an opportunity to bring about the One World Government they've always wanted - using the scare of Global Warming, oh wait, tre calling it Climate Change now, lol, to redistribute wealth, collapsing capitalist governments in the process. One World Socialism - that is their goal, and tre using this myth to bring it about.  	31	2
2017-07-05 14:22:48	JohnDoe	 Mason one world government world would be impossible to form and maintain without unimaginable loss of personal freedoms and bloodshed to get there and then maintain (think dystopian hunger games capital city on steroids) there would be gulags for political opponents, and despotic leaders taking the largest portions and relegating socialized poverty for everyone else. It's bizarre that anyone would even need to have this spelled out. Man is too inherently evil to possibly create positions of power on a world govt scale without the "cure" being worse than the "disease".  	35	2
2017-07-05 05:11:50	James Mason	Actually, we predict that, unless trends are reversed, all the ice will be melted by as soon as 2050. Personally, since I expect some countermeasures to be put in place, am guessing for something more around 2100. Also, why would a one world government be a bad thing? Do you know how much we could accomplish with all the world's resources pooled into one organization?  	31	6

But I think, mankind will swich to renewable energy long long before this scenario and mankind will undertake climate engineering to stabilize the earth's climate.  	31	6

2017-04-28 01:32:55	abdul7591	We know that in the Middle Ages temperatures were er than tre today.  was actually green, which is why the Vikings were able to live there. It was possible to plant vineyards in England, and it was an age when Europe, with its construction of enormous cathedrals and burgeoning urban life, was prospering. People were not freaking out about the water level rising, and there is no reason to believe that coastal cities in places like Britain and France were threatened - because they're still there, many of them having preserved their medieval architecture. What this video is presenting is not science. It is scaremongering nonsense propagated by environmentalist extremists who are driven not by a desire to make the environment cleaner and safer to live in, but rather by a political desire to control people, to tell them how they can and cannot live their lives.  	31	2

2017-07-23 08:18:55	Hezeldo	This comment should be removed for promoting psychopathic-religious carefreeness towards real issues instead of solving them. Also the ice melting in the Antarctica is ON TOP of the the land, and since ice is compressed water, it means that that land would be overflooded, again, but this time with non-frozen water, since the land lies below what at that point will be sea level. So your argument is invalid.  	5	6
2017-06-29 19:22:16	Mark Bjering	 and what god should that be out of the many fake fantasy gods your talking about ?  	37	5
2017-06-28 14:39:34	XieXie ThankYou	 It's not the U.S fault. No one is forcing the other nations to keep poluting. But fear not, the Earth is fine. Global ing is false. The ice melting in Antarctica is the earth recovering. Under the ice there is land and on the land is frozen vegetation. Meaning that the ice is the only thing not normal. Because it used to be green. We are living post flood of Noah. We used to live bellow the current sea level. That's why there are underwater cities or sunken cities. The end of the earth is coming and it is brought in by the evil works of men, seek God and be right with Him. He is the only one that will matter in the end, we all die once and then comes judgement.  	31	2

2017-06-24 16:00:11	Mark Bjering	+kimmelay71 ya some guys just think lets earn even more money poluting the world. sure the tempreture would proberly still rise even if we where not here. but i would not take only 100-500 years for that to happen, rather it would take way way longer if we where not here. not to mention that we have no idea if it is going to stop at some point. we could be making a greenhouse effect that will fuck us up. But anyhow even lets say nothing if this will happen. by stopping with poluting we would still temove stuff like smog in cities. and lower canser wictims. and so on that a fact. so why are there so many s that just think of them self. and want to ignore everything just to keep the econimy going with polution gases.  	20	2
2017-06-24 14:00:35	jimmelay71	Some s believe there is no global warning, some believe man has nothing to do with it. The water still rises and the temperatures still increase.  	20	2
2017-06-24 13:39:58	Ron Mexico	You must really hate Cavemen that caused super massive flooding 12,000 years ago.

2017-06-14 16:12:06	Chad Jennings	I was more joking but to be honest im all for greening it up a bit, first things first though, if youre going it do it find a better less destructive form of energy that has decent power trade off and i dont want to hear anything about electric  because if you have seen what a lithium mine actually looks like then you know thats even worse next, stop the production of all things plastic, but honestly the only true way to correct the issue of our giant carbon footprint would to depopulate  	20	2
2017-06-14 15:57:46	Mark Bjering	Jimmelay71 i agree. I tried to exsplaine this to some people that, sure the earth is going having these natual cycles. but we are speeding this up a lot. and why is that we are putting so much crap in the asmosphere that normaly would not be there this quick. what can this mean. that humankind can go even further then the normal cycles. and create a green house effect that is way way way worse then it has ever been on the earth. the dinoes could not do this. but Humans can and thats what we are allready doing. But lets all just be like  Jennings and ignore this and just keep poluting. it's not like it's going to be that big of a problem in our life time -.- (jokeing) I would rather make sure that we as humans are not to blame and go more green. it would be better for the health of humans anyways. we remove smog, smoke and so on from cities with gives cancer and other health isuses, so why not go more green? it's a win win  	20	2
2017-06-13 15:41:17	jimmelay71	Wow, I love the stupidity of people who still can't understand that 7.4 billion people and all their machines and alterations of the environment could cause climate change.  	20	2

2017-06-11 12:40:57	Mark Bjering	ya thats what i was trying to say chenkai Zhou. :) Man people in america just think america is the best place in the world, witch it just not true, they got way more people on the street, way more crime, way more people without education, way more people in a war, a giant dept they have no chance of ever paying back. I could go on. where most eropean contries is way off is all those areas. I'm not hating on america. but i'm tired of seeing american people always putting them self so high up on the pedistal like they can do anything wrong. example. I saw a dokumentary ones where american talked about spce weapons, and they said stright out that  else but america was allowed to put up satalites with weapons since  else could manage to controll that kind of power WOW. I guess again that european would proberly handle it better then america, and then there is rusians who would be in same footing with america in that regard. This was just one example, there is a lot of this going on in TV americans thinking tre the only ones who can handle thing.  	9	5

Just look at how heavy rains in that metro area have flooded the islands, making them off-limits (@ least for the rest of June) to anyone other than: - residents of any of those islands - city work crews - emergency services workers - Toronto Island Ferry staff - anyone staffing the ferry between  Bishop Airport and the mainland - news crews authorized to tag along  	31	3

2017-04-19 00:41:53	Jimmy Page	The sea levels don't rise because of ice melting, because the mass of the ice is already in the water. The reason sea levels will rise is the increasing temperature. When it gets hotter, the water temperatures rise, because when water molecules are heated they becomr bigger and need more , therefore the ocean is rising.  	5	6

2017-04-16 16:09:25	Ryan M	This is if all the ice in the world melts, which is unlikely because some time within the next century global ing will end (hopefully). By that time the water would only rise about a meter, which is bad but not as bad as what this video suggests.  	5	6
2017-04-30 15:21:37	Ryan M	Actually, coal factories have already become obsolete, even the Chinese are starting to transition away from them and as we have done a long time ago. But you're right, some kind of immensely profitable renewable energy source will have to come to save the world, but as nuclear fusion is almost here, I think that this will happen within the next few decades.  	28	1
2017-04-30 15:12:39	Melon Lord	True enough, but I think you have a bit more faith in humanity than I do. To truly end global ing requires a monumental effort that comes from the ground up in terms of manufacturing. Until factories running on renewable energy can out-profit coal factories, even everybody living vegan yoga lifestyles isn't going to save the world.  	3	2
2017-04-30 14:20:50	Ryan M	Obviously nothing human created like global ing will end on its own in 100 years, but you can't honestly think that we'll still be burning gas in 2117. A hundred years is a long time and based on current technological innovation rates, I think that a hundred years more will see the end of global ing due to gas being replaced (nuclear fusion, most likely). I am not suggesting that global ing will end on it's own, but it will end. Yes that means someone does need to do something about this, but unless you're a nuclear physicist, I doubt that there's anything you or me can do so we might as well just sit back and wait for someone else to end global ing.  	3	2
2017-04-30 11:22:08	Melon Lord	AKA we still actually need to do something about this, because there is no fucking way global ing is just going to end on its own in 100 years. A thousand years? Pushing it. A million years? Likely a natural stop. A hundred years? No fucking way unless we suddenly stop all industry, which we cannot do without new technology.  	3	2

In BC ia the capital sits on Vancouver Island which is basically 99% at sea level so we can assume we and all the other islands off the coast are gone. Vancouver is definitely sea level so all of those people will be gone. But it won't because we don't exist. Putz!  	31	2

2017-04-11 00:07:36	Ric Trexell	If the north pole melted, there would be no more water than if it stayed frozen. The northern ice cap is just floating on the water. It is as if you put a glass of water in your freezer and let it freeze, then let it melt. You would not get more water. The southern pole has an average temperature of minus 57 degrees. That probably will be a while before it thaws out.  	5	6

2017-03-31 08:39:55	Penny for your thoughts	so what you're trying to say is it would look like it was before the ice caps were formed and before some of the mega volcanoes erupted. causing the Ice caps to be formed. so ya I call that Earth's evolution if you want the ice caps back just wait for another Mega volcano it must be getting ready to erupt causing the ash to fill up the upper layer of the ozone layer with Ash blocking out the the sun's Rays causing the Earth to cool down creating the ice caps again. the earth is heating up causing the ice caps to melt MEANING THAT A MEGA VOLCANO IS ABOUT TO ERUPT!!!!!! ( start preparing start storing up food and water and medical supplies if you want to survive Mega volcano explosion causing an Ice Age ot occur.)  	31	6

We can all move to the moon, there we will be safe. There is no evil water or ice on the moon, we can even go to mars if we want. There are many options.  has invented  travel just in time to save humanity. How can there be global ing if the earth is flat, and is not a globe? I think I may have just solved the dilemna of the century, is there a Nobel prize for my discovery? Can I also question the mile high average ice t covering Antarctica claim that has been proffered? Average thickness of a mile, so in places maybe 5 miles thick? yawn.  	31	6

Take a glass of water and place an ice cube in that cup.  the water level on the cup, come back after it is melted and you will notive one thing. The water level has not changed at all. This is because the ice cube itself already took up all the  it needed. No flooding will happen if the ice melts.  	33	6

2017-03-24 17:06:20	Freedom Storm	MALE BOVINE SCAT ! More hype from the "climate change" loons. The earth was once 85% covered in 1 to 2 MILE thick ice ts. That has melted over the last 13,000 years, to a point where possibly 2 to 3% of it remains. So what's going to happen IF that melts. Not much. But it's not going to melt. In the 13,000 year cycles from coolest to est and back, again and again, the earth has already entered into the move back to the coolest end of the spectrum.  	20	2
2017-03-24 19:57:04	J Calhoun	+ You are correct in general, but not in the details. Not all the ice will melt and we will start another ice age. However we are still in the final stages of the current ice age, and global ing and melting of the ice caps will continue until enough of the arctic ocean is uncovered to change the moisture patterns. When that occurs, heavy winter snows will begin in the northern latitudes, with the added snow cover at high altitudes remaining through the summer. This will have the effect of raising the earth's albedo again, reflecting more heat back into  and cooling the air and land temperatures. Each year, more snow will be added, and more will remain throughout the year. Popular scientist of that era will begin to warn of "global cooling", and the masses will begin to complain of man tampering with the environment. Eventually, the global ice packs will begin to thicken and the sea levels to drop slightly as the cycle begins all over again in earnest.  	31	6

During the last  spell, 125,000 years ago, the seas were about 18   feet (5.5 meters) higher than tre today. About three million years   ago the seas could have been up to 165 feet (50.3 meters) higher.   According to the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC), if all glaciers melted today the seas would rise about 230 feet (70 meters).  	5	6

2017-03-23 16:02:33	Michael Ramos	actually no. it depends how much ice it floating on the water. it's max height is determined by weight and already accounted for. it's the ice on land that adds. but even then taking the square footage of water coverage of the planet and calculate how many cubic inches of water put on its surface to combine to current water will raise the water level 1 foot. One foot is not dangerous, 50 or 100 foot over the millions of miles of ocean and lakes. Yes lakes, because oceans evaporate and rain falls to fill lakes. do your calculations and research then get back to me  	33	6
2017-03-23 16:01:07	Kevin Ludwig	if you fill a glass with ice, then top off the glass with water, the ice is above the glass. why doesn't the water over flow the glass? Because ice expands, think about it.  	33	6

2017-03-23 01:04:33	maxbass	It's pretty comical. Doesn't anyone remember (if not Google it) the Global Cooling Craze of the 1970s? Wait, the same people who told us Florida would be overrun with Polar Bears only 30 years ago are not telling us the oceans will bury us under water. I guess people don't apply logic to these topics. For some reason, science has become a political topic. I was at Glacier National Park in Montana. The world has obviously ed a lot since thousands of years ago when those glaciers created amazing smooth swaths of valleys through the mountains. You can see how the glaciers were obviously in the northern US & . It's irrefutable. So Global Warming has clearly been happening for some time. Thousands of years at minimum despite what the media force fed everyone in the 70s.      Of course, in the 1970s the world thought they would freeze to death. Our fertile land would be frozen tundra. We would all freeze to death. Now in the new millennium, people think man is creating an environment that will destroy us all within a few hundred years from ing. Really? I mean come on, pick one side or the other. Stop going from A-to-Z. That's the problem, it isn't science as much as it is political ideology. I believe the world is ing. And I'd like to reduce the carbon footprint of humanity, without question.      But if you aren't an ideological person...the world has been doing this over and over and over. Do you ever ask yourself or are you even aware that the movement now for ing was a movement for cooling only 40 years ago?      The world would be a better place if everyone from all views used a little common sense and looked back at not-so-distant history. It doesn't even take any brain power to see what was being said then, who was saying it, what is being said now, and who is saying it. And if someone then was saying cooling and today tre saying ing, wouldn't it be logical to question their motives for having such a drastic change of view over such a short period of time?  	31	2

Ice caps are just future massive killer glaciers, that will eventually spread and crush enormous swaths of the Northern Hemisphere beneath miles of their ice.      Humanity will manage er weather and loads of new beachfront real estate. We'd have a tougher time dealing with millions of cubic miles of ice crushing everything in its path.  	31	6

2017-03-22 17:51:52	Lilac Lizard	Take a bathtub, fill it with water, now take some large blocks of ice & put them on the "land" (ledges) around the outside of the bath & let the ice melt & drip off it's platform into the bathtub water & guess what, your bath now fills over doesn't it! Now heat the water & it will expand & even more will spill over!  	33	6
2017-03-22 06:53:53	Majorx240	 the problem isn't the ice floating in the sea. The problem is the ice covering the  Pole which is on land, not sea and all the glaciers of the world. When their ice becomes water the seas will rise.  	5	6

2017-03-24 14:01:05	Sevenfold120	How couldnt they? All the oil in Iraq goes under water and Iran has a navy and since you cant have a country under the water Iran therefore gets territory rights over the water. Iraq is gone and since Iran is too mountainous and obviously Iran is Shia so all the sunni refugees in Iraq will run to Saudi arabia or something. Iran obviously wins.  	11	3

2017-03-20 01:31:57	Dave -in-NJ	WARNING : a little bit of fact to fill in for the insanity.   20,000 years ago, the Earth was in an ice age, everything above Virgina in the US, all the way up to Santa's Workshop was under MILES of ice.   Sea levels were 300 feet lower. and like now, 80% of the people lived withing 100 miles of the shore. ALL OF THOSE CITIES ARE GONE. underwater divers find whole cities underwater, it is not odd, it is the result of the glaciers that were 2 miles thick over New York city melting.   now, the shore line is 300 feet higher and all that happened was people move up hill to the new shore line.   TRUE SCIENCE would tell you about that FIRST, and then explain why, in the brief 20,000 years, things changed.   Rememer the Pueblo Indians ? lush river valley, supported hundreds of thousands of people. now desert.   See the pyramids ? once in the middle for forrests, now in a desert.   The other thing you are not told is that the earth's axis has more to do with ice ages and golbal ing than anything MAN could ever do. and that the magnetic poles 'flip' and when that happens, the surface of the planet slides around. ask geologists about this, COMMON KNOWLEDGE.   so, we KNOW, through SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE, that the planet has done this over 10 times, and based on SCIENTIFIC evidence, we are actually late for the change.   WARNING : if you are not PREPARING for both the next ice age AND excessive global ing with PASSIVE housing, you are creating your own future of failure.   NOTE : the politicians know this and ARE PREPARING, they have the shelters, the food, they have THEIR survival planned.  	31	2

Hence why the medieval period was  and why a "little" ice age followed. If anything more CO2 is better. Plants need CO2 for photosynthesis. But I do agree that mass industrial factories does effect the area that surrounds it. You can just look at Shanghai, China and see how bad it is. I remember how 2012 was an extremely  year but since then we haven't had any summers compared to it.  	20	2

The facts are the oceans have not risen one threatening iota. So far. This is all politically motivated. Just the real facts please. The temperature goes up and the growing seasons in the northern hemisphere like  and Russia will increase and CO2 will be absorbed more. More plants will grow. CO2 is a life giving force to the planet. It is plant food. We could not live with out it. CO2 was 100's of times more prevalent in the past. Where do you think carbon came from.. It is the same as it has always been.. Now just absorbed in Oil and Coal by plants.  	31	6

2017-03-12 03:16:24	Marianne Fischer	This is such anti-scientific BS. It takes heat energy to melt ice. If all the heat energy now falling on  were to fall on Antarctica, it would take that energy two to three thousand years to melt the seven million cubic miles of ice on that continent. But since only a fraction of Antarctica ever even gets above freezing, and then only for a month or two during the summer, it's obvious that that quantity of heat energy is nowhere to be found there.      Moreover, the majority of glacial calving and ice melt is occurring on the Antarctic sea ice shelves. That ice is floating on the ocean. When floating ice melts, it does not cause sea levels to rise.      Antarctic ice has been measured at 740,000 years old, and might be twice that old at the lowest levels. It has survived interglacial periods nine degrees er that we have today.      Geez, people, stop believing the propaganda.  	31	6

2017-03-09 22:08:02	Tom Gruber	If you have a full glass of water with ice floating above the rim, when the ice melts, will the glass overflow? NO! Didn't Newton teach us that for every action, there is a equal and opposite reaction? All the worlds ice already is displaced either on the oceans or the land is being pushed aside by the ice's weight. Newton would agree that there would be virtually no change if all the ice melted. When a glacier disappeared in Alaska, the area rose at its relief of weight. Antarctica is said to be depressed up to an half a mile by the ice covering it. If its ice melted, wouldn't the crust below stop being pushed down and out against the oceans? Stop listening to "chicken little" so called scientists who say" the sky is falling or the water is rising. Give us money and we will tell you when the sky will hit us and how to prop it up" or in this case" how we can stop climate change." Or can they full all the people all the time  	31	6
2017-05-05 00:19:26	Tom Gruber	At least Nicholas has an open mind. Also, the earth is only solid on the surface. Its core is liquid and this seemingly solid surface does flex with the lunar gravitational pull,else we would not have tides. We could say that the earth's crust it floating on molten lava below. Thus, ice on land still displaces by its weight the flexing crust below. Up to 1993 we measured the earth's average temperature in 6000 places. Starting in 1994, we eliminated 2000 of these measuring places. However they only compared the averages to each other and not the identical 4000 places. Suddenly, there was a whole degree change. Then, each year after was one of the hottest on record. Since you are a self proclaimed expert, maybe you can find where they have hidden their data, as I could not find it on the internet. I have heard that President Trump can't find it either. Incidentally, what does Fornicating Under the Consent of the  have to do with the kind of  you called me. {i.e. F---ing } Closed minds revert to animal insults. Keep believing what you agree with and you will never grow. I don't believe like my name suggests {doubting } until I can grasp it in my hands, see it with my eyes and understand it with my mind. You accept what you are told, don't question what is popular and reject what is logical. Which one of us would have argued for a flat earth and spontaneous generation because they were popular and so called scientists told us to. '  	35	2
2017-05-04 19:48:32	Gods Demons	While his thought process is flawed to dismiss his thoughts simply because "Scientists would've thought of it" is also a flawed thought process. Don't forget that the top intellectual minds in the 16th century thought of Galileo as ic for believing the Earth revolved around the sun when anybody looking at the sun could clearly see it was moving. Scientists are just as human as us and they let their own beliefs cloud their judgement too. What Tom should've considered is while the glass won't overflow, the water level will rise if the ice is not submerged, the ice ts are not submerged so the water level will rise if they melt. Other questions to ask are, "If the world is hotter, and the total area the oceans cover expands, will more water evaporate allowing it to reach more desolate climates?" because if so that could significantly decrease the amount of flooding that happens on the Earth, by transferring that excess water to desert areas. And if water goes to desert areas, then those lands quickly become inhabitable, which will offset the amount of land lost due to flooding. A er Earth could very well have many positives, but climatologists will never look into that because if the public stops being scared, then they can't get funding, which means they're out of a job.  	31	2

2017-05-02 17:46:09	monterrang	yes tom when the ice melt, the continent under it rise but you forgot 1 thing in scandinavia (which was under ice 18000 years ago) we see a rise of land *BUT IT ONLY RISE AT BEST 9 MILIMETERS PER YEAR....* when you add the fact antartica and greenland are pushed from 1000 to 3000 meters because of ice you would realise it would need aproximately 111 to 333 THOUSANDS year to emerge fully... which i say if you await for that good luck my boy....  	5	6
2017-04-24 01:56:18	hamad bakheet	 there is some logic in what you wrote my friend but the there's two issues about it but before that I want to tell that I agree with on the ice- water displacement but only if the ice is floating on water . so firstly , saying the land would rise if the ice above melt is true , but what will happen is that only the land were ice melt will rise but other continents and landmass won't so rising level if water will only spare the ice bearing lands . secondly , in geology there is a previous recorded event of sea level rising due to ice melting in the topology of many now exsiting cities , which is a clear indicative of what my happen .  	5	6
2017-04-23 18:42:34	Claude Vanlalhruaia	The amount of stupidity and complete ignorant I found in  post is astonishingly too much for my brain to hold. No wonder people are mocking the n education, with these half as knowledge and ignorant its a wonder how your country ever became a global superpowers. He is talking about displacement, he got the theory right but he doesn't know that displacement can be applied only when there's a (here comes) "displace-fucking-ment", of course if all the ice are in the form of ice berg or some floating mega island then actually melting all the ice will lower the sea level. But, majority of the ice are stored in land masses, they do not displace any water and if they melt they will bought many changes to our world which includes rising of the sea level.  	31	6
2017-04-22 15:15:13	Vlisto	 You're fucking moron. How dare you pretend he would side with you. He was a GENIUS. Of course the oceans would rise with melting ice. Only ice IN water displaces water. The massive stores of ice on  and Antarctica are mostly on land. Therefor they DON'T displace water. Melting ice on land would have it drain into the ocean, and do what? It would raise the water level. The law that states that every action has an equal and opposite action is pretty irrelevant here by the way. You're only using it as a buzz.  	5	6

2017-03-07 03:52:52	903IDFOLEY	The water level in the glass _does_ actually change when the ice melts, it's just not very noticable because there is very little ice above the original water level due to how ice cubes floats with 90% of it's volume already in the water. When you look at pictures of the Arctic and Antarctic ice pack, and the snow and ice sitting on top of Antarctica, you are looking at two whole continents of ice/water sitting above the current sea level.  	5	6

2017-03-05 05:08:43	Truth Seeker	For all the ice at the poles to melt, there must be a few degrees rise in global temperatures. That leads to ice melting but also increased surface water evaporation (from oceans and lakes) around the globe. This means an increase in humidity and rain fall.   This means that more deserts will turn into forests rich in vegetation and trees that consume lots of water and more ground water around the globe.      Not all of the polar ice will end up in the ocean.  	5	6

The ice from Artic is the bigger resource of water all around the world and it fleet on the Ocean. According to Archimede weight of water deplace is propotionnal to the volume place in it. So when Artic will melt , there will be no rising water. It remains  Pole and glacier but it it negligible ! So don't believe everyone ;)  	31	6

Dump the weight in the ocean and the sea floor transforms under the change in pressure. Sea floors drop, landmasses rise. The resulting map is a guess since we don't know a lot about how our planet is actually made or transforms, we only have clues so far. The change in the average earthquake magnitude is an indicator of this. There are so many factors involved, that claims made here cannot be proved, only theorized.  	31	2

2017-04-28 08:47:17	Lilac Lizard	What government subsidies? Are you serious MishchievousMoo?   fuel-subsidies-carbon-trudeau  fuel-producers/6936474  subsidies-put-at-5-6bn-a-year-in-new-report-43490/ How many links would you like? & what countries would you like them for? Here's a couple of quotes to summarise "A report earlier this year from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said that after-tax energy subsidies were expected to reach $7.4 trillion or 6.5 per cent of global GDP in 2015." (that's globally) next bit is 2013-2014 figures "– G20 governments provided almost $US78 billion a year in national subsidies for fossil fuel production; G20 state-owned enterprises invested $286 billion, and public finance was estimated to average a further $88 billion a year in 2013 and 2014; – Japan provided more public finance for fossil fuels in 2013 and 2014 than any other G20 country, averaging $19 billion a year, with $2.8 billion a year in coal finance alone; – The UK stands out as the only G7 nation significantly ramping up its support for the fossil fuel industry, with even more tax breaks and industry support handed out to companies operating in the North Sea in 2015; – The US provided more than $20 billion in national subsidies alone, despite calls from President Obama to scrap support to oil, gas and coal; –  and  both provided approximately $US5 billion in national subsidies, including for development of fossil fuel resources in increasingly remote and challenging areas; – Russia provided almost $23 billion in national subsidies, the highest of all G20 countries – China’s investment in fossil fuel production at home and abroad, through its state-owned enterprises, far exceeded any other G20 country, amounting to almost $77 billion annually; – And even Turkey, this year’s G20 host, is giving tax breaks to support its program of building more coal plants than any other OECD country, potentially raising its own greenhouse gas emissions by 94 per cent over the next 15 years."  	31	2
2017-04-28 03:36:26	MischievousMoo	What government subsidies? I never heard of oil propaganda. All I'm saying is $3.50 per kilowatt is more than $0.30.  	7	2

We're always told all the bad stuff but here's an interesting fact that could actually be a positive if we allow global ing to continue. Obviously global ing is NOT a hoax, the only question is how far will the oceans rise & how high will temperatures get. Will the images in the video become real? lets hope not But it's an interesting look at what's possible if we do nothing  	20	2
2017-04-21 20:04:23	The Tranya	Congratulations. You've swallowed the bait - hook, line, and sinker. Because of this completely fictitious and speculative video, in your mind, global ing will eventually connect the lake with the ocean.

2017-03-26 14:31:37	Lilac Lizard	Person, this is what happens when you listen to the 3% of non-climate scientists for your global ing info! Do you have any idea at all what argument you're actually trying to make? I said (all be it as a joke) that we should throw away solar panels & you come back at me saying I'm wrong & humidity is all I need to worry about & that somehow increasing the humidity in the middle of  is going to cause everything to dry up faster? Please Explain! Just so you know, "water vapour" when taken as a climate measurement is referred to as "humidity" humidity = % of water vapour in the air. It impacts how hot you feel, how quickly your washing dries etc but lets say you go into a sauna & pour a litre of water on the rocks & push the humidity up by 20%, the temperature gauge on your thermometer won't move, even though it will feel MUCH hotter. As for Carbon dioxide blocking out sunlight, how does it do that? You mean the way it provides extra particles between earth &  to get through? That's why it's referred to as a "blanket effect" when those particles of radiant heat are unable to travel through the mass of CO2 particles in the atmosphere to escape the earth. Note to anyone else reading, who has more accurate info than me from the 97% of legit scientists, please feel free to correct/add more technical info. I'm only a lay person, but pretty sure even most of us lay people on the planet know the super basics like humidity being a reading of moisture/water in the air  	20	2
2017-03-26 12:45:18	Person.	+ Problem with that, is Global ing would just cause all that water to dry up again and the world would get hotter and hotter.. Carbon Dioxide isn't the problem. It's water vapor. Water vapor is the number 1 reason why we have weather, climate change, and more. The more water vapor added to the air, the hotter it gets. Simple. Carbon Dioxide has little to prove here, and in fact is actually making the world colder by blocking out excess sunlight, much like the Ozone layer is already doing for us  	31	2
2017-03-26 10:24:10	GetShrekt2196	 Its all flat  	35	7
2017-03-22 17:35:18	Lilac Lizard	Yup it's lake Eyre, which apparently used to be forest running from the North through there millions of years ago. In heavy rains today, the excess rain flows from the top of the country down to that "hole" to create an inland lake but then everything dries up again. So it would seem that global ing is going to take away our huge desert & replace it with the moisture/humidity needed to again sustain forest through the centre of the country. I guess we should throw away our solar panels & start burning some fossile fuels! Looks like it's a huge win for us!  	31	2

2017-02-28 11:07:00	Blake Belladonna	I think what people are forgetting is that this would take a CENTURY to happen. The half life of buildings is only a few decades. Meaning populations could easily migrate inland fast enough to prevent mass flooding. There would no doubt be some ecological damage, and a lot of historical locations will be underwater, but humans would be pretty unaffected. And the overall loss of land area is fairly negligible. More concerning is what OTHER effects this would cause.  	1	3

Cities at the coast will start to build dams, will be stilted or in worst case, vanish with the people relocating to the new coast. The midwest however is going to dry out. We will see if there will be any farms left then.  	1	3

Sucking up all the oil from the earth like leeches is one of our main mistakes. Sinkholes flooding and temperature changes in our weather are some of the few signs that we are destined for disaster. How we treat Mother Earth is how she's going to treat us back, but they don't care because it's all about the money but our kids will suffer and grandkids.  	31	2

2017-02-25 19:33:59	BMan18	The Arctic Ocean Ice is already in this mix; so, the water won't rise as it melts. The rise is just from the glaciers and Antarctica's ice melt. Presumably also sinking much of Antarctica. Expect the effect to accelerate as these land sources of ice start mixing with the water. Those are the hot spots to watch.  	5	6

2017-03-27 19:19:43	Helicoly	Actually, the dunes already protect a large amount. Of course the sea levels won't immediately rise like this so there will be time to build them up to be high enough. I believe it is really possible, also because the Netherlands have made many different islands for other countries and have shown a lot of promise in being able to do these things. It might cause a big debt because it will cost a lot of money, but it is most certainly possible.  	31	3

If the planet gets er, land like Siberia and the northern reaches of  will become temperate cropland with fertile soil and increased sunlight for even higher crop yields. Land that currently can only be used for growing grains can be used to grow vegetables and tropical crops. We'll end up with about the same amount of arable land, it'll just be in different locations. We'll lose some man-made buildings on the coasts, but we'll be able to build new stuff on the new coasts. Overall, it doesn't look like a major catastrophe for our species.  	31	1

I would not be surprised if all the media fake news that is so much ideology over facts, that fake news like russia hacking the election, the REAL news, like what can be done to protect our planet, will be in the dumpster for the next 4 years. however, the new pipelines will drastically cut down on emissions as millions of trucks will not be on the road carrying oil. ideology = zero - environment +1 !  	20	2
2017-03-28 23:43:04	Nicholas Castellon	+Proofessor  trump being elected does not mean global ing stops.  	20	2
2017-03-28 11:41:27	Dave -in-NJ	phil : here is the simplicity. the EARTH has done this over 10 times, probably 10 times that. this we know. so, if it is MAN, and we stop today, does it stop the ing? if it is NOT man, no matter what we do, the ing will continue. those are the only two options. 'act now' the ONLY 'act now' is to make PASSIVE BUILDINGS and put an END to the need for heating and cooling and the MASSIVE energy needed to heat and cool a building. back before autos, the thoughts were trains, boats of  ? the likes of Henry Ford saw a decent bushiness in trains, none in boats, but a massive profit in . thus the car was the choice of the MANUFACTURERS. jobs and lots of them. today, we can re- think that. trains could run the routes of most  and both a fraction of the cost to make and environmentally. you cannot STOP people from surviving. but, you can offer alternatives that are easier and lower cost. There is no reason in the USA to permit a single building to be built from this day forward that is not passive. and every reason to make low cost houses passive. the smaller, the easier. end wasted energy use. If I could take a battery golf cart a mile to a train and then from the train to my work, I would stop my commute and all the wasted energy for one person to drive 60 miles a day. ditto for my wife who drives further. other countries with huge populations do just that.  	31	2

2017-03-19 21:33:28	YouReadMyName	@ Do you realize that the average height of the icets is 2 kilometers high?, so 3% of that over the 70% of the earth that is water is 2000*0.03/0.7 = 85.7 meters rise on average, yea, that's enough to drown most coastal cities and low lying land.

2017-03-10 06:49:20	Jennifer Gosling	it's was certainly slim pickings to choose from a power hungry dodgy female and a power hungry dodgy ego maniac of the one percent clan male. We of the female gender are so desperate for that symbol of equality at the highest office that it mattered not her dodginess. Dodgy people will get the just deserts eventually. Give the "wang" the chop. But then given the size of the hands of the one who got elected - and the saying about the size of a mans hands and the size of his "wage" - probably not far off being a female president.  	12	2
2017-03-10 05:29:08	Asher Weems	You do not need to complain about the ice melting from global ing. Just look at . The carbon there is far worse so before you complain about earth just ask people there. Freaking stupid ns (I specified "stupid" don't complain about my descriptions of stupid people I would not say all people in my favorite country are stupid just look at people like me and you will know there are good people).  	20	2
2017-03-10 05:19:55	Asher Weems	 Global ing is not caused by humans. It has been going on for alot longer than we started with the carbon emissions. It is true hat we are significantly speeding it up.  	20	2
2017-03-10 05:16:44	Asher Weems	lavertable If people become smart there will be no female president because of worry of hillary Clintons ideas. Oh wait a second people would still be stupid thinking one bad person represents a gender. Oh wait a sec people think they need hillary Clinton to represent females to prove tre stronger than males. Wait a third second if females are stronger than males why do they need hillary Clinton to represent them? So basically what I'm saying is that it doesn't matter if we have a female president just not a bad president. I'm assuming you mean hitlery Clinton.  	31	1

2017-03-03 06:25:18	Jim Kuhn	You like Facts? Ok...Fact: 90% of ALL the Earth's Ice is located on Antarctica. Fact" Antarctica comprises just 3% of the total surface of the Earth. Fact: Oceans cover approximately 3/4th of the surface of the Earth. Therefor...if all the Ice there were to melt, and be dispersed to all the Oceans of the World...the actual rise of the level of water would be nearly infinitesimal... between 5/16th to 3/4 an inch. ( Just a rough guess)  	5	6
2017-02-26 02:26:20	Ray Conlogue	Yeah, in a sense that's actually true, as long as you include the rest of the body, which will die from toxic gases being released from a million year frozen sleep by the ing climate caused by. . .climate change. Since you seem to acknowledge this, I hope you will also search YouTubeClimateChange or YouTubeMeltingAntarcticIce. I'm serious.

2017-02-16 03:40:30	Ivor Petrie	This is beyond hilarious. Do all those making comments actually believe this garbage. Basic science folks. The North Pole is a huge ice cube. Ice is less dense than water so if it melts water levels go down.  Pole sits on land and has more ice than North Pole. I'll spare you the maths but the sum difference is about 3" as 2/3 of the earths surface is sea. The only other serious quantity of ice is on  and that would add about 1.4" to sea levels. Sea water temperatures have been totally stable for years just look at NOAA data. The sea is rising but not due to temperature or ice melt - in fact serious scientists don't know why. But just to round off the hilarity to those who are worried, the ice cores in the Antarctic can be pulled and show global temperatures for the past 10,000 years when it has been vastly hotter and vastly colder. The fact the core ice exists means the Antarctic ice doesn't melt even when Earths temperature rises by 7 degrees from present so you can all go to bed and rest easy (sigh).  	31	6

2017-02-15 21:40:17	Peter Moseley	even if the entire surface of Antarctica (5,410,000 sq mi )had 1000 feet of ice when you spread that across the 510,000,000 miles of ocean it still only raises 10 feet...and that is before the mass it loses when being melted...did these scientists never go to grade school???  	5	6
2017-03-02 04:59:14	Peter Moseley	 Siemers multiply my numbers by five or even 10 and you're still only halfway to the 200 feet  claimed by the video, and you aren't taking into account the 3rd of the mass lost from melting, or how much would actually seep into subterranean holes in the Antarctic continent...I'm not saying there wouldn't be water rise, I'm saying it would not possibly be as bad as they make it out to be...also many of the mountains would undoubtedly keep their snow caps...and the scenario that I lay out requires the entire continent to melt completely which is not a claim by any global ing scientist that I know of...  	31	6
2017-02-17 21:36:09	Alex Siemers	The Antarctic ice goes at least 1 mile (~5000 feet) deep in most places and can reach up to 2 miles deep (~10500 feet) in quite a few areas.  	5	6
2017-02-15 21:27:53	Peter Moseley	so ice content the size of  would somehow raise the water level of oceans the size of 3 Asian continents???? Not to mention ice losses mass as it melts into liquid form...where did these scientists get there degrees???  	5	6

2017-02-15 20:43:57	Eduardo Hoover	According to the science of the three states of water; ice, water and vapor; ice has the most mass and thus as it melts to water and is released to vapor water levels actually lower. There is a great quantity of floating ice that will offset the glacial runoff so water level will remain constant. STOP TRYING TO SCARE PEOPLE!  	5	6

2017-02-14 05:59:36	EarlJohn61	And don't forget that the amount of liquid water is also affect by evaporation, if the planet is hotter there will be more water evaporating... this will reduce the eventual high water levels somewhat (NOT negate the increase but reduce it!)      This will, of course produce weather changes of its own design... more water vapor in the air... MANY more rain clouds in the sky... MORE rainfall in most areas ie: Deserts that currently get < 5 mm (0.2 inches) per year might increase to perhaps 7 mm (0.3 in) per year (+40%)   Other areas on say 500 - 750 mm (20-30 in) per year might increase to 700-1050 mm (28-42 in) per year... OR EVEN MORE!      (I don't know the exact figures but every 'model' I've seen/heard about concentrates on melting and says nothing about evaporation.)  	31	6

2017-02-12 15:22:51	Geoff Halsey	Melting Ice on the sea wouldn't be a problem, as when water freezes in also expands. Water is at it's most dense at 4 degrees C. Sea levels would drop in this case, only to expand again when temperatures got above 4 degrees. The melting ice on the land is obviously the problem.  	5	6

2017-02-12 12:13:06	Michael Trimboli	I do believe it is a commonly known fact that water expands when it is frozen, and since most frozen water is located at the poles, and therefore will melt into the oceans (as most of it is already in the ocean), why would the water levels across the world rise? Since the melted water will take up less area than the ice did, I do not imagine the water levels around the world would raise that much. Does anyone know more about this particular aspect?  	5	6

No it doesn't, same with the icecaps. If they would melt (ain't gonna happen ) nothing would happen to the ocean levels.  	31	6

2017-02-11 02:00:22	DonMeaker	The facts are we don't know. We do know that because of the ice at Antarctica the south pole is pressed in, and the ern Ocean sticks out. If the ice at Antarctica were to melt, we don't know how much it would snap back out- a lot, completely, or a little. If it were to snap back out, so the south pole was not pressed in, that would create a lot of room in the ern Ocean for water.      The north pole doesn't have so much of that because the ice there floats.  	5	6

2017-02-10 19:21:57	Azycray	If water expands when it freeze's, and we all know it does, that is why water lines break when they freeze. Then when all the polar caps, s, glaciers and Antarctica melt, it should shrink and take up less , or close to the same  since 10% of ice is above the water line. I would like to see the figures or stats that are the basis for the flooded earth scenario if all the ice melted. I'm just not buying it without some concrete reasons. I just don't trust baseless doomsday scenarios that are repeated ad nauseum without sound reasoning to back it all up.  	5	6

2017-02-08 22:02:11	Holly Oakley	Actually this is a lie. If the ice caps melt we would have another ice age. That's how the last one happened. The ice caps are made of fresh water not salt water. When they melt more fresh water enters the Gulf Stream. Which causes major changes in weather. It also allows the ocean to freeze at a higher temperature. Fresh water freezes at 32 degrees.  water freezes at around 25-28 degrees. Believe it or not that change can cause significant weather change  	5	6

Some low sea level islands and the Netherlands would be in trouble, and the coasts would be pushed back by about 10-15ms here and there, but that's about it.   What you are showing here is is like 5-6ms of sea level increase for which we would need about 25 more Antarcticas.  	5	6

2017-03-21 19:48:14	Oliver Scribner	i do not know where the fuck your getting your numbers from, but the antarctic ice t has about 30 million cubic km of ice, it might not be incredibly thick, but it covers an area of 14 million square km, and if you include the ice caps, and the  ice t, they could potentially raise the ocean level by about 70 meters, effectively wiping out nearly all coastal cities, and those subterranean caves wouldn't do shit with how much water is in Antarctica alone, which is about 90 percent of the world's fresh water encase you didn't know  	5	6
2017-03-21 19:05:34	Peter Moseley	and all of those numbers are assuming it melts rapidly enough to not have time for the water to seep into the ground, which at least a small fraction of it would  	5	3
2017-03-21 19:04:02	Peter Moseley	plus the melting would expose subterranean caves which would fill with a small portion of the water as well  	5	3
2017-03-21 19:01:44	Peter Moseley	GalenDragonay even if the entire surface of Antarctica (5,410,000 sq mi )had 1000 feet of ice when you spread that across the 510,000,000 miles of ocean it still only raises 10 feet...and that is before the mass it loses when being melted...even if you double that or triple or even quadruple those numbers to account for  as you noted it still would not even be half the see level rise that the video claims you have to have over 4 miles of ice over the entire surface area of Antarctica (which only had a couple of miles tops in select places) to even come close to the 200 feet rise claimed by the video, you fail to understand just how big the ocean is apparently  	5	6

2017-03-02 05:09:00	Peter Moseley	lol...there isn't enough ice in ask of Antarctica (which isn't much bigger than ) to raise the water level of the entire Ocean which is approximately 2/3 of the entire earth by 200 feet as this video claims...especially when we remember from grade school that water will contract as it melts decreasing it's over all mass...  	5	6

2017-02-04 02:57:06	Fedora Shaman	If the water is rising, it's not because of melting water, otherwise this planet would have been screwed over ages ago as far as terrestrial life. It's just that the plates of the planet are shifting in such a way that certain land masses are "sinking" into the ocean. Part of it is erosion (we're dealing with it here in California), and the other is constantly sinking and rising geological activity. In short, even if certain landmasses sunk, that plate activity will eventually result in a new landmass. It's a cycle of the Earth that has been going on forever. It's not "man made", as there was more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere than before we discovered automobiles. Anyone who says we're going to end up in a Waterworld scenario is a fanatic  whose bought in to climate change like it's "the greatest threat to mankind." It's a problem, perhaps, but not the worst thing to contend with, and since it's a cycle, I think we're smart enough to handle it as it comes. If not, then a lot of rich people are gonna have to move.  	31	2

2017-01-29 19:47:58	Gary wood	Wait, so gravity and fluid dynamics laws are suspended when the solid H2 o on the Poles turns into a Liquid but doesn't stay where it is and suddenly flows toward the equator ?   Sure how my fridge /freezer doesn't break down .....when the ice cube melt the water will pour from the fridge and wash out the door to head to Florida.         btw   I did some math on this theory for the earth flooding. The pacific ocean alone is about 15,000,000 sq miles , even if all the Ice in a Arctic melted ... the total volume for the area and thickness couldn't fill up Lake Erie . All of the ice on both poles did not come from NEW water because almost every drop today was here when the Earth formed into the current version of the solar system .   The Ice caps are frozen water that was there plus layer of frost build up or snow melting . Just the Pacific with 15 million sq miles would take massive amount of water just to raise in 6 inches . Just 1 square mile is over 25,000,000 square feet of surface which means that a 6 inch rise will be 12,500,000 cubic feet for water.....then you have the other 15,000,000 square miles not including the Atlantic and 100,000s of inland Lakes retaining the new rain cause by more clouds that will block the heat rays and cool us down to be like Vancouver's fog and overcasts .      The earth is already close to 74% of the surface as water , good luck raise all the Ocean water on earth just 3 inches. YES, the records show water lines in some coastal rocks or inland valley . But the Earth flexes and buckles while the ocean floors split apart of collide.      More heat with more liquid H2o means more air born H2o in a gas forms as clouds that can hold tonnes of water that block out light. All that will happen is more usable land for food with more water to grow food while a new Mean-temperature will exist with more rain . Hot and cold areas will move to the center just enough to be livable with less power for AC and Heating . Why don't we ask people right now that live on the equator how they survive in that heat since Al Gore claims that those condition will move North and  by about 30 degrees latitude where people in Nashville TN can grow Pineapples and Bananas in the back yard.      Now tell me the down-side to global ing.  	31	6
2017-01-29 18:20:12	WakenerOne	Good thing Antarctic ice is **increasing** faster than Arctic ice is melting, then, huh? Seriously, though, like in a Geico ad, if you're a climate, you change.

But and then:   \- The air humidity will rise, hense all current deserts will become Eden gardens. Live - globaly - will literally explode and flurish. Just like it did many times earlier in Earth's history before (The Cambrian Live Explosion);   \- Some humans will have to move away from the submerged areas - so what?! Was the city of San Francisco there some 500 years ago? Not, of course. We, humans, can easily move. Yes, we can! ;-)  	31	6

2017-01-29 05:37:03	Soham	 Siemers really??but i knew that the arCtic and most of the antarctic ice cap was floating on the oceans. Which is why explrations on the arctic was so dangerous.  	31	6
2017-01-29 03:11:36	Alex Siemers	Most of the ice on Earth doesn't displace ocean water, it's on land masses like Antarctica and . The planet's current sea level doesn't account for this glacial ice.  	5	6

2017-03-15 19:15:12	PushandillPushback	no matter how deep or large the ice, when it is submerged it is already displacing the entirety of it's mass in the water, meaning that if it melted it would just dissapear into the ocean and the water levels would stay the same. Try this simple test for yourself: fill a glass with water till just about completely full, and then add ice until the water reaches the rim and is about to spill over. The ice will be raised slightly above the water level because it is floating at this point. Wait for ice to melt and observe: did water levels raise, or did they stay the same. You will find they stay the same everytime. The water gains no mass in it's liquid state (only density) so it cannot possibly displace more water as liquid than it could as a soild. Therefore SEA LEVELS DO NOT RAISE via floating ice cap meltings. Just think about it.  	5	6

But - and there's always a but - the fact of the matter is, that under the melting ice the crust begins to rise to whatever level it had before the glacier formed, and correspondingly the crust under the oceans (where it is thinner) begins to subside under the growing avoirdupois of the meltwater. So sure, some changes will occure in low lying coastlands, but no catastrophies.  	5	6

2017-03-19 22:58:35	Oliver Scribner	yeah forget the data which shows that the climate is changing at alarming rates that are parallel with increased co2 emissions, and forget the fact that although at times the earth was in fact too hot to have ice caps, humans were not where we are today, and so the damage and scenario is just teensy bit different, and  says to hand over power to wealthy elites, especially when many wealthy elites are the ones perpetuating the lie that climate change is a myth, it's a serious problem, that can be easily prevented  	20	2
2017-03-18 19:07:05	Tyler Dolezal	Yeah, forget the fact that all that carbon came from the surface before it was buried. Forget that the planet goes through natural cycles and has been without ice caps in the past. Climate change is a scary apocalyptic scenario so you better hand over authority and wealth to the elites who are going to fix this problem that they keep telling us about.  	20	2
2017-03-18 13:44:20	Oliver Scribner	right, the elites who probably realize that fossil fuels will be gone by 2050? the oil companies probably know this too, but they don't care. and the elites or globalists as you say, might not give A fuck either, but that doesn't matter, cause climate change is still a thing and if we continue on the path we are on now, it will seriously cripple the human race.  	20	2
2017-03-17 15:00:57	Tyler Dolezal	To those thinking "But the fossil fuel companies are the money making machines trying to suppress MMCC" ever think of the elites and global rulers who are more powerful than the oil bs who will make out like bandits when they double tax energy? Once (or twice) for the tariffs/sales of the fuel and another for the use of it (carbon tax).  	20	2

2017-03-15 02:52:46	SpecialJ11	This comment is the most ironic thing I've seen in a while. "Money making machines" The primary money making machines with a vested interest in disproving man made climate change are energy companies that emit gasses into the atmosphere. "millions of years of evidence" Yeah, ice cores show the natural progression of Earth's CO2 and cooling and ing trends. The past "100 years of data" shows that we have begun to skyrocket away from normalcy. As for the "unreliable data", I don't know where you're getting that. Science is all about doing thousands of experiments by different scientists to check again and again what's true or not. If the majority of research points to climate change, then that's what the scientific community (assuming they're not paid to think otherwise) will accept that as the leading hypothesis. For decades companies have paid to cover up the harm they're doing. Lead and tobacco are two that immediately come to mind. Why would this be any different?  	20	2

They've tried to disprove it by throwing millions at scientific research, but still 95% of scientist agree that it's real.  	20	2
2017-02-21 13:03:11	Phoenix Rising	 Morgan We just came out of an ice age. Civilisation flourishes when its not being frozen. We are meant to leave this sphere in due time before the volcano/asteroid/solar flare hits - thats the biggest concern: superceding the next extinction event.  	5	2

2017-01-29 03:38:35	Alex Siemers	But this ing trend has been shown to be more than anything normally seen on the planet.  	37	2
2017-01-25 03:06:45	Denny D Speed	Never going to happen. The earth is a living sphere and will correct itself as it did over the last million years. Physical evidence of this is already happening as the northern caps are melting but the southern caps are growing at about the same rate.  	35	2
2017-01-25 03:01:44	Blue Eye	What if I told you? About half that's projected to be flooded isn't real. The reason why ice floats is because water when solidified doesn't compress, it's molecules expand. When a glass of water has ice, the water level stays the same when the ice melts. This is because of the less condense ice molecules, the ice peaking outside of the water is what keeps the water levels lowering from loosely packed molecules.   If all of the world's ice caps melt, we don't have to worry much. But there will be raised water levels because of some ice caps with land underneath them. Places like  and small islands under Antarctica should be our only worries of ice melting.  	5	6

"IF" The oceans levels "continue" to rise... c o n t I n u e . But there is no proof of "continue". It rises...then recedes. There is no data that shows a continuing trend of the ocean levels "only" rising. So dragging my President into it, only proves you have small hands. Get over it.  	20	2

2017-03-07 23:20:14	Stephen	So it's man made, because before the 1900s, things were stable. Either way, if we accelerate a process by increasing its rate by 1000%, then it's man-made.  	37	2
2017-03-07 21:53:30	Matthew Brunette	Bob A Can Of Koosh Which is why I said we're helping things along kind of like a laxative.  	38	5
2017-03-07 21:21:37	Stephen	@hew Brunette It would take thousands of years for the average temperature to even change by 1*C, but we've managed to go up by 3*C in just the last 100 years.  	20	2
2017-03-07 21:15:06	Matthew Brunette	Bob A Can Of Koosh I never said that. Humans may be helping along the process but that's it. The actual phenomenon of climate change is a natural occurrence.  	20	2
2017-03-07 20:48:47	Stephen	@ So the increased volatility of weather, increased temp, more snow, more rain, shorter cold seasons, ocean level increase, and the reduced glacier area are negligible?  	5	6

2017-03-07 20:02:50	Stephen	@hew Brunette So the trillions of kilograms of co2 and methane we produce, which traps heat 4x as well as normal air, isn't affecting the climate at all?  	20	2

2017-03-07 18:58:04	Matthew Brunette	 Climate change is real;however, it's not a man made phenomenon.  	20	2
2017-03-07 15:32:46	Stephen	@Maximum Borkdrive While you are right on that ice melting in pure water doesn't increase the water levels, be oceans contain salt and the glaciers don't due to a somewhat complicated chemical process.  water is about 3℅ more dense, so when it's more diluted due to glaciers melting and combinign with the salt water, the concentration and thus density of ocean water decreases and increases the water level.  	33	6
2017-03-07 05:27:21	Sid	It's not, this isn't either. Put some ice in a glass of water, when the ice melts there won't be any difference in the water level.  	33	6

2017-03-05 07:30:49	Duncan McCockiner	That's just what you _want_ to believe. Actually, he's been clear all along that it's the distribution of environmental agency funds that's a scam, not global ing.  	20	2
2017-03-05 01:42:21	Josh Adams	 you can't say it's a "hypothesis" or "conjecture" as it's actually an observation about sea levels rising in his location. It's not like you live anywhere near him. Flowers and blooming more early and it's clearly getting er causing animals to come out of hibernation earlier. I'm not saying it's 100% Green house gasses causing Global ing, it could be the cycle of the earth around the sun every thousand years. I'm just saying there is more proof of Global temperature and radiation levels rising than you would have saying otherwise. Oh and please get your grammar correct next time. You're using s in the incorrect context. lol @ U  	20	2
2017-03-05 01:32:03	David Misner	That is not proof. That is an hypothesis. 1. a proposition, or set of propositions, set forth as an explanation for the occurrence of some specified group of phenomena, either asserted merely as a provisional conjecture to guide investigation (working hypothesis) or accepted as highly probable in the light of established facts. 2. a proposition assumed as a premise in an argument. 3. the antecedent of a conditional proposition.  	37	5

2017-03-04 00:24:19	Josh Adams	 People that don't believe in global ing are seriously stupid. Not because of there view point but because tre watching a video on how global ing could effect us and not believing in it. It's like me (an atheist) walking into a church and preying to 'God'. Don't comment where you ain't wanted, if you do comment at least show facts and proof that Global ing isn't real. Hippies.  	20	2

2017-02-26 02:04:03	Ray Conlogue	I agree that you can't see the future if you're using a crystal ball. But, , scientists see very accurately into the near future by studying the atmosphere and taking thousand foot long drill sections of ancient ice from Antarctica which tell them how the atmosphere has changed in the past ten thousand years. From there it's not hard to predict what's coming up: the ancient ice has virtually no poisonous gases in it, while ice from the past two hundred years has suddenly gone from no poisonous gas to terrifying amounts of unbreathable methane. Please, all of you, stop writing empty sentences like "none of us can see into the future'. That's just cowardly bullshit. And it insults the tens of thousands of men and women who devote their lives to climate change science. They're trying to save YOUR LIVES. The least you can do is think before you write sentimental nonsense like "none of us can see into the future'. I think most of you are smart enough to do better than that. We CAN see into the future, by listening to the people who devote themselves to what the records of the past are trying to tell us.  	31	2
2017-02-26 01:55:32	Ray Conlogue	None of you can see into the future if you're working with a grade school education. I'm not saying you need to graduate from university. BUT you have to up your viewing and interpretation skills. A good place to start is the hundreds of climate change videos on YouTube. The ones that come from research institutes and universities are the most useful because they focus on information, which is what most of us are short of. Try searching: YouTubeAntarcticaClimateChange. That will also lead you to videos about the loss of thousand year old sea ice and the release of poisonous ancient methane gas which was previously locked under thick ts of ice that never melted. Every day thousands of gallons of million-year-old methane are bubbling into the air that we all breathe. The scientists who make these videos go to a lot of trouble to make sure people like you and me can understand them. Please, please watch them. This is happening in my country, . But don't kid yourself that this environmental breakdown will not affect . This is the PLANET, my friends. The whole fucking planet is affected. Also, unlike the world-destroying lies coming from  and his comical army of deniers, liars, Hitlerian nutbars like  Bannon, and assorted other subhuman fuckups, the science videos are almost sadly honest and earnest. It breaks my heart to see these men and women with their two or three PhDs trying desperately to get everyday people to pay attention to their message. Put it this way: what does each side want? Trump is clear on what he wants. He has $5-million invested in the Dakota pipeline that will soon pump tens of thousands of gallons PER DAY of dirty fracked oil across  and onto ships to China, where the oil will be burnt to support China's expanding population. Trump has other, equally odious, investments which he is concealing from the people who elected him. Most of us can understand that you don't want expanding populations on a planet that isn't getting any bigger. But it's hard to find the courage to say that the U.S. President, as big an asshole as he clearly is, is denying the facts through his lying teeth and making fools of citizens. Nonetheless, that courage HAS TO BE FOUND. And used.  	31	2

2017-03-14 23:43:36	WinterIce	+Deathpool991 Wrong, The Old Testament is included in tian "Thought". The Ten Commandments ( 20) are featured in almost every tian Church in existence, and the reason tians are still fighting for Young Earth Creationism to be taught in schools in a modern western nation..... in 2017, is due to the very first chapter, in the very first book in the bible (Genesis 1). as well as the story of Cain and Able, Noahs Ark, , etc all being taught to tian children. Besides, even if I was wrong (Which I'm not)... (((Jesus))) was a Jew, and his (((New Testament))) is a Jewish creation, therefore tianity is a Jewish Religion.  	37	5
2017-03-14 23:18:36	Eazalah	 tianity is based upon the new testament not the old anything that happened in the old cannot be applied to tinity as the follow Jesus's teachings not Abrahams  	37	5

Thinking of White genocide - which is on par to the ideas of  - based on corrupted statements in religious texts that, as a whole, almost  takes *completely* to heart. And those that do are the radical groups that makes everyone in that religious group seem like horrible people, *when tctually are just fine.* Just because you are a tian doesn't mean you take every verse of the Bible to heart and act upon it, although that seems to be what you are thinking. Go ask some religious people if their thoughts somehow line up with what you think they would be.  	37	5

2017-01-23 04:39:49	rustyscrapper	For everyone who thinks sea level rise will be catastrophic, we know that sea level rose about 80 meters after the last major glaciation by about 1 meter per century. This was when kilometres thick ice covered  and russia. Most of the earths ice has already melted since then. The rate of sea level rise has slowed to about 30cm per century. Even the worst case of global ing isn't capable of accelerating ice loss causing sea level rise of more then 1 meter a century. There isn't enough ice, it takes a long time to melt kilometres of ice. There is enough ice to raise the sea by about 20 more meters, and it would change coastlines but understand the time scales. It will take 2000 years minimum, assuming global ing catastrophe and 6,000 years naturally. We have time to build dikes and break walls, and Here is a crazy idea, stop building stuff 1 meter above sea level  	31	6

Till then, your children and or grand children will probably leave the place and live on places further from the sea. The worse thing of this is the wellfare.  country are going to become poor and the social security will colapse. Wars will occur. Those are the worst parts. OW and it can get worse than that. If this happens then it will happen with the point of no return. This means that the earth will  up on its own and keeps ing up which will result either a very very very big cold ice age, or a very very very very  planet like . All life on earth will eventually get fucked anyway. Humans will be able to survive underground but only a very very very small populations and procreate. But they will all die too when all systems underground fail or if all resources are used.  	31	6

2017-01-21 19:33:20	Wise Up	In the last 300 years the earth's sea level has risen by about 60cm... you expect me to belive that in the next 100 it will raise by a Meter... about 3 feet... but then in the video you show 216 feet of a rise in Ocean levels.... Wouldn't we be out of fossil fuels long before we reached an ocean level anywhere near that, not to mention that could be 1000 years or so?  	31	3
2017-01-21 18:39:42	Clay Rains	If I want to see just how braindead humanity is, I just read the comments section of videos like this. I have to laugh at the climate change zombies who can't seem to realize that this is if ALL THE ICE ON THE ENTIRE PLANET melted. That includes not just polar caps, but every but of snow in the mountains and everywhere else under 32 degrees. You also don't realize that does not take into account that the vast majority of the north pole's ice is ALREADY under water.  	31	6

2017-03-01 22:52:09	Paul Taane	That consensus is paid for by the corporations that earn income from it. The biggest issues are direct connections to the financial interests. CO2, general pollution, and our current extinction event nuclear accidents have already taken the Earth from our children. The powers behind the "consensus' have already killed you.  	20	2
2017-02-28 20:57:45	poitsplace	, That figure simply cannot be reproduced. There most certainly is a consensus on climate change. But even that has problems. The criteria used to establish a "consensus" with the IPCC for example is that they believe 50% or more of the ing since the 1950s was likely (not certainly) caused by the enhanced greenhouse effect due to man's CO2 emissions. And that amount of ing is so trivial that it includes almost all the outsn skeptics.  	20	2

2017-02-28 04:49:25	Ryan D	TnTMaN 04 Seriously? Dude. If you actually believe that, I pity you. It's obviously unclear, because, as of right now at least, there is no major effect. Like, at all. But... it hasn't been debunked. What has been debunked is our effect on it. I currently do not have the approximate statistics, nor am I willing to look for them. Just know, that these have been proven, but are not exact. Mankind does not have that big of an effect that you all think it does. A healthy, living planet (such as earth) has these cycles. It's ice caps will melt, it won't reflect almost any sunlight, heat builds up, it becomes excruciatingly hot, Gases cloud sunlight from getting to earth, earth freezes, gases go away, it heats up, now it has a healthy balance. We are currently in the "Healthy balance" stage. But, with our technology and/or "pollution" it throws this cycle off track. But throughout the entirety of earths existence, life has continued to live throughout all cycles. Albeit not all of organisms have survived, this is evolution. I think man contributes to 3% of "global ing" but the other 96% or so is the cycle going through its course. We could obviously slow this down, though I'm not going to post theories. This is inevitable, though. Whether we like it or not lol. Global ing DOES exist. It's just we don't really contribute to it that much. Even though 3% is a shit ton of stuff and it would still help if we stopped it. Again don't quote me. P.S. When you argue with someone, do it respectfully. Your point gets across easier and you might cure them if their ignorance.  	20	2
2017-02-27 22:34:12	weee wooo	TnTMaN 04 Actually, I'm not gonna argue with you. You play MINECRAFT for god sakes and you sound like a 10 year old. Fight with kids your own age and stop trying to act tough online, it really doesn't phase me kid.  	38	5

2017-02-27 21:30:50	wash beezy	Ok !! Everyone calm down.  can deny that climate change is not real. What people argue over is the cause. Let's keep this civil and not act like a bunch of morons. For clarification I believe man has a negligible impact on it.  	20	2
2017-02-27 21:22:44	Triveom	amelia the meme god Search it up fucking online. There have been people who have debunked the whole "Global Warming" Myth. Its fake. Do some research if you want to talk smack to a smarter person.  	20	2
2017-02-27 21:03:25	poitsplace	I almost replied to him complaining about that, because there is evidence that the earth is ing, and therefore to say global ing isn't real is misleading. On the other hand, you say there's proof that it is both real AND...destroying the planet right now. What exactly is it doing "right now"? In the media and politics there's this vague hype that destruction is "happening right now" but there's nothing anyone can ever put their finger on that actually proves true. How is it being damaged/destroyed right now?  	20	2
2017-02-27 19:48:02	weee wooo	TnTMaN 04 I'm pretty sure you're the dumbass if you think global ing is fake. There's PROOF that it's real, and it's destroying the planet right now. by no means am I defending Ray, I'm just stating facts. since, you can't even spell discovered, you're probably 11 or something, which I don't feel like arguing with a 11 y/o.

2017-02-26 20:51:13	poitsplace	Actually, a nuclear bomb detonated beneath antarctica would only set off seismogs. The interesting thing about the antarctic ice t is how stable it is. Once it forms it keeps temperatures far too low for it to melt, and the continent is more or less bowl shaped so not much of it flows out through glaciers. That's why there's over a million years of snow piled up there. What it does do though, is eventually it submerges the continent by so much that it undergoes a kind of ocean inundation collapse  	5	6
2017-02-26 03:30:02	IVAO04ify	The only way it will happen over night to a catastrophic level are two viable scenarios Ray. First, man intentionally does it, detonation of a Nuclear Weapon beneath Antarctica would be most viable. Second, would be for something like an asteroid causing an equal amount of damage equal to that of how our moon was created. So by your own s, take off your own tin-foil hat and grow up. You've watched way to many videos and obviously never spent a day in the field.  	35	2
2017-02-26 02:22:00	Ray Conlogue	No, you're not. Take off your tinfoil hat and try to watch some of the climate change videos on YouTube.  will stop a million years' worth of stored methane gas, which is now bubbling from the bottom of oceans and lakes everywhere, from making our atmosphere poisonous. Even where you are, my little flower. Grow up. Find a way to be useful.  	20	2

The average volcanic eruption puts ten times more CO2 into the atmosphere than man has ever done. with an average of 30 - 40 eruptions a year...yes we are making it worse but only by a miniscule amount. the only reason we should need to stop using fossil fuels is because they're limited and shortages could lead to wars over resources such as coal and oil  	20	2

So far  has proven conclusively that man contributes to global ing or that it even exists. Just a bunch of hype, propagated by governments as a reason to tax us in hundreds of new ways.  	31	2

When i think about the USA the whole florida is wiped out and Miami is gone forever.   And if the ice melted Calcutta will be gone forever, and  get a new water pond.

2017-01-03 01:00:07	OnideusMadHatter	They're only irreversible because the US and the UN have both made geoengineering ILLEGAL... which should really tell you something. Fortunately though... you're wrong. Just as the world didn't flood back in the Holocene Climatic Optimum (when it was MUCH er), it's not going to be flooding any time soon.      First of all, water EXPANDS when frozen and since the majority of the ice is UNDER WATER, well if it melts it contracts by a significant amount. Not only that but it disrupts the saline concentration which in turn makes the ocean water EVAPORATE EASIER, which means more clouds and more rain... so we'll get an increase in monsoons and we'll get RAIN FORESTS... everywhere! Just like during the Holocene Climatic Optimum and just like all the other  cycles before then (there's been tons).      And even the land based ice ts, if they melt, MOST of it will go INTO THE GROUND or INTO THE AIR and then dumped on land elsewhere. With any luck we might even get the Sahara rain forests and grasslands back!      Despite the crazy hysteria being peddled global ing is actually a GOOD THING!  	31	2
2017-01-26 07:53:31	dan b	 and even if what happens like they show does happen, it doesn't look that bad, like this is really really survivable, like the only other things we can get is bad weather, that's easy to adapt to with our tech, the only things that we can't defend from (earthquakes/tsunamis) aren't gonna be made worse by this  	3	1

2017-01-25 15:08:39	Chad Birrell	 It's got to do with how high the land is above see level. After sea level rises this area will be below sea level. The Nile will still be above sea level.  	5	3

2017-01-01 11:19:20	josepla yer21	The polar ice caps are going to be completely gone in about 40-50 years. Portland Oregon is going to be underwater by then, Portland is also expecting an 8.7-9.1 Mw earthquake within the next 50 years. Whichever one comes first, Portland Oregon is fucked!  	1	3
2017-01-01 11:04:10	Plebus plebus plebosaurus	i don't think so... the poles are pure ice, right? well, ice has less density than flowing water, wich means that an even amount of water takes more place as solid ice than liquid water. If it melted, the level of water would not change, unless the ice on the poles are sitting on rocks or other stuff that lift it above the ocean (i don't know about this). Here's the experiment that makes me doubt: Put an ice cube in a glass and fill it with water until it's about to pour off. put the glass on a paper t and wait for ice to melt. The water is at the same level.  	5	6
2017-01-01 10:13:57	314.159.265.358	This is extremely disturbing, but what's even more disturbing is the fact that ns just elected a president who doesn't believe in Climate Change... **sigh**  	20	2

2017-02-15 08:17:20	Greg Moonen	Go sit in your car at midday on a sunny day, roll up the windows, and just breathe. Have an identical empty car next to yours, maybe put a body-sized bag of water at 98.6 degrees for good measure. Measure the temperature difference. Your car with the CO2 you've exhaled will be quite a bit er. It's an experiment you can do by yourself. The temperature difference is due to the trapped CO2 absorbing sunlight and converting it into infrared. We now have more CO2 in our atmosphere than any time in about the last two million years. Worse yet, it's happening at a time when the Sun is closest to us during January and the summers are longest. The CO2 levels are due to everything they've ever been due to PLUS man-made emissions, and that amounts to a lot more CO2. I've done the research, forty years ago. The oil companies are making money hand over fist and they're so greedy, they don't care what happens as long as they get richer. They have so much money they can afford to buy our government and spend hundreds of millions of dollars on propaganda to make ignorant people believe global ing is a hoax.  	20	2

Even at campuses like UCLA where the recycle bin is literally 3 feet from the trash can... the students would throw recyclables in the trash... at fucking UCLA! It used to drive me nuts. If the supposed intellectual elite didn't give a crap about the environment, what chance do we have? Only in the 2000s, did it become vogue to be environmental. People are fucking stupid in . I sometimes hate being n. The level of irrational thought and inability to think for themselves by the majority of the people is annoying and horrifying.

2017-06-04 18:32:01	Spring Bloom	+ Maybe our kids and their kids need to adapt, like every living thing has had to do for the entire history of life? I really do not get how people who believe in science, can think the environment and climate, could, would, or should, remain stable and comfortable, for one self-absorbed species. The simple fact of 'global ing' is that any effect Man has had on the climate, has likely delayed the next glacial maximum, which is an exponentially greater threat to Humanity, than expanding temperate zones, increased rainfall and loss of a few hundred feet of seafront. When we talk about the effects of global temperature increase, we are talking about a comfort zone, not a Biblical catastrophy. The only people who will find it catastrophic, are the people who measure success, by luxury, comfort and routine laziness. Westerners have gotten soft and dependent upon machines and other people to do the thinking and work, for them, so they can focus on important things, like pleasure. We have become noptable and unfit for survival. Thats the threat to our grandchildren.  	31	2

2017-01-31 15:51:23	Ian Macfarlane	@ If that's sarcasm, sorry it's lost on me - I live in the UK and know nothing about Canadian or Russian immigration policy. However, if it's easy now it doesn't mean it will be easy in 50years time. It might be better for everyone if the ice caps didn't disappear altogether.  	5	1

2017-02-13 09:57:58	Dirk Schiefke	Well according Archimedes prionciple of displacement the Northpole doesnt matter that much of course it just takes some more place when frozen (think bottle filled with ice in a cooler) but considering the Antarctica ice covering a huge landmass being several 100s of meters thick and  if all the water gets into the oceans that would certainly make you worry. as that is not on sea level or beyond and would certainly fill a up the oceans a wee bit.  	5	6
2017-02-06 05:08:57	Daniel	GradeA's Kid I'm waiting for you to look it up and realize you're wrong! Keep us posted!  	19	5
2017-02-06 04:57:44	Daniel	GradeA's Kid lmao When floating ice melts, it doesn't displace additional water. Look it up. I know it's not intuitive.  	33	6
2017-01-16 05:52:24	Daniel	AsianCockCaucasianAsianCajun s Actually, when floating ice melts it doesn't make the water level rise.  	33	6
2017-01-03 03:16:28	Manuel Sacha	@AsianCockCaucasianAsianCajun s So, you and the guy above you corrected me by *REPEATING EXACTLY* what I said in both of my posts? Seriously? And you even act all superior and insult me? FFS, get an education! And that includes knowing common behaviour rules as listening/reading/understanding everything your interlocutor is saying *BEFORE* replying (let alone attacking them). PS: Having an Asian cock is not something to brag about. I'm truly sorry to be the one to bring you these sad news.  	38	5
2017-01-03 00:08:20	AMilkyBoi	Ffs, get educated. Ice indeed occupies more  than liquid water, however, most of the ice is above the liquid water, therefore making the water rise as it melts.  	33	6
2017-01-01 20:33:37	Baker's Bread	but alot of the ice is also above the water  	33	6
2017-01-01 16:00:38	Lonzee Is Cool	 so the water levels would actually go down???????  	11	3
2017-01-01 11:58:23	Manuel Sacha	@ Well, no, that's just wrong. Ice occupies more  when it's solid, than when it melts into water. It's science.  	33	6
2017-01-01 11:07:24	josepla yer21	The amount of water that the ice caps displace is a lot less than when it melts. Put a ice cube in a glass of water and watch the water level rise as it melts.  	33	6
2016-12-31 08:13:06	Donevin Frownfelter	 yeah and a lot of that is is connected to the already in the water ice,not all but slot of it,but y- damn you autoerect  	11	3
2016-12-31 07:49:06	Manuel Sacha	You do know that *A LOT* of said ice is above surface level, right?  	33	6

2017-01-19 09:23:50	Zayaan A	You're being kind of racist. Please try and meet a muslim or go and visit a Muslim country (might I suggest the UAE or Qatar) and learn the religion. Have you ever been to Bnagladesh? Or known a muslim personally? Just try and learn because not all muslims countries are shitty (some non muslim countries are worse), Most muslims are very regular humans who keep their opinion to themselves and aren't violent and racism is never the answer. Imagine if you were one of those Bengalis who're afraid of dying from the floodings. How would you feel if  took you in because you would be a "shitty muslim" in a "shitty muslim country". Most of the times muslims are the victims, not the culprits. Just look at Mosul, Aleppo, Palestine, Yemen and so many more. These muslims are suffering and you call muslims bad people.  	30	5

2017-01-11 09:47:44	AndreBrachioToothless	Yeah....he's basically saying, let the homes of nearly 4 billion people drown so that a land that is named by the Vikings to promote the land ( and it was OBVIOUSLY after the last ice age ) can become green again , like during the Dinosaurs era!! . And yeah , I know....that scenario I described is unreal and will actually never happen to that extent , it WILL still pose a threat (my hometown , Jakarta in Indonesia is actually about 4 to 5 meters below sea level and is still sinking) , especially to Indonesia , ippines , Oceania and ESCPECIALLY poor poor , Bangladesh ,I'm sorry for them...And while his point is right (built floating cities etc.) , what about the country that cannot afford that technology? Will the rich country be able to support them all? or CAN they tolerate them? (Just look at the Syrian refugee crisis) . It is  , especially for China , since all of their large cities , home to their population is all in coastal areas . Yes , the earth does has a cycle of ing and cooling , but even if today the earth is on the  period , there is still no available explanation on why the carbon emission and co2 is at its all time high? with more than 400 ppm of carbon , can the earth survive that? can the extinction of thousands and thousands of species even faster than the Permian extinction be acceptable for them? Tre hungry , hungry for power , hungry for money , hungry for the profit , turning their backs on the only planet that can sustain them in the entire solar system  	31	2
2017-01-11 09:24:23	Zayaan A	andrebrachiotoothless I was just being vague. I know that a lot of land will submerge and so many people will die but I seriously couldn't map out ever single one. Thanks for being more specific. And why is that  before you talking about rising sea levels as a good thing. Do you even science bro? I seriously can't see why he's calling us selfish when he's saying that everyone should drown so " can become green again".  	11	3

Tokyo plains will be flooded so thats 40 million and Keihanshin metro is also 20 million , don’t forget Nagoya metro of 11 million , and if you include Nagoya , lets also include all of Japan’s coastal cities of Hachinoe, Sendai , Sapporo , Hiroshima , Nagasaki , Kumamoto , Shizuoka , and niigata , home to nearly 20 million ,  east asia is even worse . The Jakarta metro and its adjacent metros will be completely submerged , rendering almost approx. 50 million homeless , Indonesia’s coastal cities , home to almost its business and industries will be submerged , the Manila metro , home to 30 million will also be submerged , Kuala ur , Bangkok , Rangoon , Singapore will also be submerged , leaving nearly 30 million homeless , And also bangladesh and the Assam region that is filled with nearly 170 million , The Sudogwon Metro a the Busan metro , along with all of  Korea’s coastal plain will be submerged , nearly 40 million will be homeless , The Rio De Janeiro metro is 10 million , Sao Paolo’s 20 million , and even the Rio de La Plata , home to maybe 20 million? , And also all of USA’s coastal city that is home to nearly 100 million people . Istanbul , a home to nearly 20 million will be underwater , along with denmark , netherland , belgium ,UK , germany , St.petersburg , Sweden , Norway and more.....  	31	1

2017-01-02 20:08:44	Sol Rosenberg	 how average, a moron that has no clue what tre talking about and is just expressing opinions on things they don't understand and have no clue about. You morons are earth cycle deniers. It is a fact that the earth has had many ice ages and many periods of non ice ages. It is fact that there are man made structures made during the ice age that are under water. It is fact that greenland was green when it was named. You morons go ahead and keep denying facts and see how that works out. The rest of us with common sense will laugh at the rich people at least, that ignored reality. We also hold any leaders in charge that ignored reality and hold them responsible for not doing anything to relocate their cities and citizens, or not building a ocean proof wall around their cities. Man cannot control wether or not we are going into or coming out of a ice age and ignoring it and what happens when it is very likely a guarentee to happen (there are a few exceptions like going back into a ice age instead of fully going into a ing period but stupid to assume that will be the case) is very stupid.  	31	2
2017-01-02 19:44:35	Sol Rosenberg	And you people are so selfish as well. We are coming out of a ice age.  was green when it was named before the last ice age. Many of us are looking forward to greenland being green again. We are supposed to be sorry for morons who decided to populate in a under water location? They ignored science and facts that the earth goes through cycles. They ignored man made rock formations made during the ice age that have been under water for a long time now showing them that the water level is rising. They ignored that greenland was green when it was named. Do you often feel sad for s? You must feel sad for rich people that steal as well and get caught. You must feel sad for people who were speeding or running red lights for fun and then got in a accident. I don't feel bad for morons one bit. Even now tre doing nothing to relocate. I do not feel sorry for someone who purposely stands on train tracks when a train is aproaching. Not going to feel sad for the guy that purposely stood outside to get sucked up by a tornado when he had a perfectly good basement or shelter to go to. All that you mentioned are suicidal morons and the s deserve what they get. They should all be locked up in a psych ward located far inland from any non ice age sea levels like the rest of the world. Or at the very least preparing for the non ice age sea levels and build walls to keep out water. Anything other than denying reality and pretending nothing will happen and they will be perfectly fine.  	31	2
2017-01-02 04:56:18	Zayaan A	Yes, but considering how much land will be gone and how many people will become homeless, there won't be any . And most flooded places aren't like Europe or  which will have barely any flooding at all, international infrastructure and very few people in extreme poverty. Many cannot afford it and those who can won't be allowed to go anywhere. You can already see how one country's refugees aren't being accepted by Europeans, imagine how many refugees there'll be when this happens and places that aren't flooded won't take them in.  	31	3

2017-03-06 10:14:10	Andrew Carling	 , well all you say is true but the biggest issue's are that because we have/are cutting all the tree's down they hold a lot of water in there root cut them down land will just flood ,the flood water runs straight into the sea as fresh water along with all the ice melt/fresh water this is actually the biggest issue , why because this iterffures with the flow of hot/cold water movement around the globe, which in turn screws the climate, weather. possible ice age scenario. ether way I think we are screwed.  	31	6
2017-02-20 01:47:03	Jennifer Gosling	I have a piece of land that is in a water catchment area, it is sloped and has a small creek running through it that flows all year my observations over the years - during summer the sloped areas of land drys out but quickly absorbs the water each time it rains. but down near the creek there is areas that stay green because the water is being held in the soil about 3 meters out from the creek depending on the elevation in relation to the creek. During winter the ground becomes so water logged I can see the water running across the surface of the ground and down to the creek all be it only a few millimeters deep. In some areas the ground is squishy and squelchy because it can not hold any more water. The areas that were green down near the creak in summer are now little lakes because the area so sodden the water can not run away so it floods in the lowest point forming the little lakes. I only hope the earth remains stable enough not to become sink holes. So what I am saying is the soil can hold just so much (from rain or ice melt) before it just runs off to a point when it can not run off anymore at which point it collects - then depending on the topogy of the land runs and collects to the point the water finds it level - in my case it is no problem in other cases it causes massive floods or torrents of moving water flowing from what ever height through the paths of least resistance till it reaches a point in which it levels out - be that still on land or the oceans. In the account that it levels off on land (farm land) it will only dissipate as quickly as the ground can absorb it (in which case the water is flowing threw micro capillary action deeper into the ground till it reaches the underground aquifers or the ocean or threw evaporation) I think the video dose not show enough, I think there would be a whole lot more flooding than it shows because of the areas that can not absorb any more water would become like those little lakes and flood and level out like that permanently or until the next Ice age puts all the water back in its place as ice once again.  	31	3

2017-01-29 05:00:00	Matthew Van Ostin	Its a corruption thing Its called a reference scam Its like if your doctor lie to you that you have cancer. Only so that you pay him for treatements & makes big money out of you Its the same exact thing. But this time are scientist. Look how many funds & jobs were created because of this "need". Look how renewable energy companies made a fortune after it Developed countries arent even exploiting some of their oil. While "third world countries" exploits their oil without limits (limit competition) I guess money is king  	20	2
2017-01-29 04:55:41	Carl Rooker	Mathew Van Ostin you're correct in that it will not melt in a day. Even if the temperatures at the  Pole or a hundred degrees hotter than tre now, it would take hundreds if not thousands of years for the ice to totally melt. But until it does, the water will not be able to get to the ground to soak in, and even if it did it could not soak in because the ground itself is Frozen. a very small portion of that water would vaporize and turn into ring someplace, but most of it is going to go to the oceans. that is how Hydraulics work. but like I said, anthropogenic global ing is a hoax that is been foisted upon us.  	31	6
2017-01-29 04:50:07	Matthew Van Ostin	Well the 4km thick ice wont melt in 1 day. It would take years. So lets suddenly antartica has 10 celcius temperature everydays Well all the process of water become cloud raining. Gonna regulate the environnement And water also soften icy ground. When you take an ice and throw water on it. It melts So nature gonna regulate that easily But rise of temperature wont happen. Because pollution cause bad quality of air & water But not a rise of temperature 70% of rise of temperature are determined by repetitive winds Thats why n y who is at the exact same latittude as portugal spain italy greece. Receive icy winter. Because n y receive repetitive icy wind from north pole while south europe receive a loot of repetitive hoot wind from africa  	31	6
2017-01-29 04:44:30	Carl Rooker	Mathew Van Ostin just to be clear, I will state that I do not believe in anthropogenic global ing either. I agree with you it is a scam. However, if you lived in any area that has true Winters, you would know that the ground is frozen and that the snow is completely melted off long before the ground unfreezes. 90% of the snow runs off into the rivers and to the ocean, and that last 10% finally soaks into the ground after the ground thaws. In some places in the Antarctic the ice is four kilometers deep. Most of that water from the ice will go into the ocean.  	31	2
2017-01-29 04:29:19	Matthew Van Ostin	For the south pole. 90% of the water will be absorbed by south pole land. And the 10% unabsorbed gonna create lakes & river Just like the end of ice age! Now its scary to know. That an actual scam. Tacking advantage that the actual population dont know much about pure science (theories, physics) I think this climate change theory was a corruption thing. To make money out of it ( renewable energy industries. Scientist getting jobs and funds out of it. Limit competition in the developed countries that sign it) Its like if your doctor lie to you that you have cancer. Only so you pay him for treatements & makes big money out of you  	31	2
2017-01-29 01:27:20	Carl Rooker	Mathew Van Ostin while what you say is true at the North Pole, the  Pole ice cap is on land.  	5	6
2017-01-28 09:22:55	Matthew Van Ostin	@​​​ the sea wont fucking rise you  Dont speak about science subjects. If you dont know physics The billions of tons of ice caps already occupy their volume of water in the ocean (its called the "archimedes principle" in english. Its like physics 101) The only way sea level varies is with the moon physical effects. Tsunami & ocean earthquakes. Or meteo imbalance (7 days of heavy raining out proportion for example)  	31	6

2017-01-28 04:08:13	Zenpai mN	 Rennet I live in , who's the real MVP right now lol  	4	5
2017-01-28 02:46:55	kyle weadock	You're a fucking . there are billions of tons of ice in both caps that can and will melt. not a million. Land can absorb a lot of water, but not along already waterlogged areas like the everglades. If the sea level rises enough, it will cover all areas that lie within that height. Its not like a sponge, and the land won't just suddenly raise up or float on top. A very High percentage of all the population of earth lives within 10 meters of sea level. So even a rise of 3-6 meters would displace 100s of millions, if not billions of people, and cause major economic strain all across the globe. You cannot stop the flow of water or the rise of sea level with sandbags or any other means in that much area all along the coast.  	31	6
2017-01-27 14:30:37	Matthew Van Ostin	And for the ice that are on land. 90% of land can absorb water easy. So there wont bee a flood as this video showed And the 10% that can not absorb water. It gonna create new lakes and river.  	5	6
2017-01-27 14:28:16	Matthew Van Ostin	Yeah. So the 1 000 000 tons of ice cap on the north pole That they stay solid or liquid the sea level gonna be the exact same!  	5	6
2017-01-27 14:26:21	PhasyX	well... it increases the mass of the bathtub. Cant english very well, hard to explain. It doesnt fill the bathtub instantly, the huge boat toy is like ice, when it is put there, or u make it sink, the water level increases (a bit) like Earth. Something like dat  	33	3
2017-01-27 14:25:54	Matthew Van Ostin	Its doesnt work like that its with the volume + weight If you take a big ice. And put it on a bath. You can notice that the water level gonna be the same weither the ice stay solid or becomes liquid  	33	6
2017-01-27 14:24:08	scars4all	Mathew Van Ostin It goes up dude And no, ice doesn't occupy the same volume as water. Ice is buoyant; meaning it weighs less than the  of water that it takes up. But  caps and glaciers are above the water so they don't take up any water, meaning when they melt, the water level will rise.  	33	6
2017-01-27 14:23:07	Matthew Van Ostin	The bath water level increase! Now imagine the boat is an ice cap. The ice cap since ts already on the sea. It already increases the sea level. Now that the ice stay solid or transform into water. Its the same thing! It doesnt change Wow i dont know how you guys debate on science topics. When you dont basic physics lol  	33	6
2017-01-27 14:18:36	Matthew Van Ostin	Its impossible to explain it easy. Use your brain a little lol when you put a huge boat toy on a bath full of water. What happen to the water level of the bath after you put the boat?  	33	3
2017-01-27 14:17:09	Matthew Van Ostin	@CWJ - CreeperWarriorJason no. The volume of ice already occupy its volume of water! So if ice melt. The sea level is the same!  	5	6
2017-01-27 13:56:11	PhasyX	so hew, what u mean is that when the ice melts, its still gonna cover the land in antarctica, and the volume of water will just flood the place? Wtf is wrong with my english  	5	6
2017-01-27 05:04:38	Matthew Van Ostin	-Ok the ice cap when they stand on water. They occupy the same volume as their volume of waters This is like physics 101 if one of you guys pay attention at school -90% land absorb water easily. That why when it rain. We usualy never get flodded - And the 10% of land that cant absorb water. It just create river or lake I have no idea how to explain this in a more baby easy level way  	33	6
2017-01-27 04:56:20	scars4all	Mathew Van Ostin I don't even know what you said. All I read was incoherent babble.  	19	5
2017-01-27 04:52:38	Matthew Van Ostin	you guys are stupid. the ice on the ocean already occupy its volume in water and for the ice on land. 90% of land can absorb the entire water and it would create new rivers and lakes for the 10% always use your brain. you guys are like zombie. if a powerfull figure tell you earth is flat with logic arguments. you all gonna follow like zombies  	5	6
2017-01-26 22:03:59	Kévin Munch	+CWJ - CreeperWarriorJason I think you don't understand that Antartica is land with ice on it. What your saying is so stupid it's like saying Norway or Siberia or mountains with ice on it will melt. On the contrary, in the North Pole, the ice floats and grows or reduces during the different seasons.  	5	6

2016-12-12 21:01:42	Douglas Dobson	it doesn't seem like we have anywhere near enough ice to melt to raise the ocean level that much. Some yeah but for some reason the science I've seen on it they don't calculate that most of the ice ts are already displacing water equal to the mass of the ice t (1) the calculations are simple flat perpendicular calculations that don't calculate for the spherical cubic displacement (2) and the calculations are done using the current flat area of land like it's all a big 90 degree perpendicular glass walled tank the exact shape of the continents now without accounting for the mass of water coming inland (3) I think if you count those things the rise would be a lot less, I would even say half or less of what this video shows.  	31	6

2016-12-12 13:04:15	Nikola Tesla	Large-scale changes in climate have occurred before, some gradual and some extremely rapid. Ancient civilisations experienced this, as we do, through changes in their physical environment, as Dr Judith Bunbury’s research in Egypt is revealing through her analysis of the pattern of changing landscapes.   People shouldn't be freaking out about it. The ice will melt down, and then gradually come back, as it always does.  	31	6

Rebuilding all of the coastal cities at the same time, jobs and wages would skyrocket, a complete global economic recovery in no time at all. Buildings are refurbished and recycled every twenty years anyway, rebuilding them in new locations would give humanity a fresh start. Stop being so afraid.      The polar ice caps are not supposed to be that way anyway, for the last 200 million years, they have been only perpetually frozen (like tre now) for about 3% of that time.  	31	6

2016-11-25 00:20:46	Mike Jordan	 would happen. It's like placing an ice cubes in a pitcher of water. The melting ice does not raise the level of the water in the pitcher as the ice cubes have already displaced the water in the pitcher. Try this experiment at home with a glass of water and ice cubes. The water level in the glass with the ice cubes will remain the same after the ice cubes have melted. If the polar ice caps were to ever melt, then the water level should remain the same as the ice caps have already displaced the ocean & sea water. This is not taught in high school science any longer as the "Climate Warming Freaks" want the students to believe that melting ice caps will flood the planet. Get a grip people!  	31	6
2016-11-25 01:10:15	yoshi boy	lol In this ice cubes and pitcher thought experiment, the amount of water in the pitcher would most definitely increase. The ice cubes store water. Melting them would release the water around the pitcher, meaning more water would be in the pitcher. This is Elementary School level science.  	33	6

2016-11-24 18:56:44	David McGee	So, let me get this straight... frozen water aka Ice expands when frozen... so the volume of water gain if it melted would be receding shore lines... or did all that learning from my science class just a bunch of made up crap?      I do not see enough credible evidence to support the theory that melting all the ice in the world would cause sea levels to rise... oh snap... did I just say that... well I guess I should expect to be prosecuted for being a climate change denier...  	5	6
2016-11-25 01:07:56	yoshi boy	Well, no, water expands when it heats. This is a well-known process called Thermal Expansion. In a simple thought experiment, the glaciers and ice caps "store water." The melting of this ice would release the water all around the Earth, putting more water into the oceans, which would rise sea levels, just as ice melting in a pitcher increases the total amount of water in the pitcher.  	33	6

2017-02-07 18:04:00	umiluv	 - yes but we're not really helping to slow things down are we? With all our intelligence and ability to mold the world to our desire, you'd think we'd have considered maybe trying to figure out how to decrease the rate at which the ice caps are melting instead of not doing anything about it. Instead we're arguing about whether it's happening or not even though there's clearly visible evidence that it is - you can see it in satellite photos. Regardless of whether it's man made or not, we probably should pool our resources to try and figure out how to stop it or slow it down. But for some reason, we're not. /shrug  	31	2

2017-02-03 22:24:41	Drakilicious	You do know we're technically living at the end of an ice age and that the caps would melt regardless right? Earth doesnt always have polar caps, they melt and freeze... or that Co2 is what plants need to live and levels were actually x5 to x20 times what tre now when dinosaurs walked the earth and its virtually impossible for us to ever reach and sustain those levels again even if we burned off all the fossil fuel reserves. We dont have enough dead organic crap to burn off to reach those levels...... and that earth... for millions of years has actually been suffering from Co2 Starvation....... yup, cap an trade brainwashes people into the global ing hoax.... but check all the stuff I said for your self. . 1) Plants and Co2 connection 2) Ice Ages 3) Co2 Levels Millions of years ago compared to now. .

And let's be real here, both those guys were being douchbags too regardless of their politics. It's more the pissy, overtly passionate _"the Earth is drowning in 10 years!"_ types of liberals that I find to be more ridiculous and laughable. Such as the OP cussing out the other side because he thinks the world is ending. So that's what I do: I laugh. And that source I linked was NASA itself, not some normal news source. A source that both sides seem to consider credible to some degree, so take it as you will. Looking at the NASA sources provided by both sides in this thread, it appears that the Earth is apparently not ing enough to worry about overflooding withing the next few years, in my opinion.  	20	2
2016-12-23 07:02:02	JERealize	Commenting about climate change? That's a controversial subject in itself, but your comment on "liberal autism" was unwarranted.

Dude this has nothing to do with anything, not saying it's not important, but I'm talking about global ing, not economies. Also you must be the type of person that cares nothing if the ice melts away and because of that, parts of the continents started being flooded, and polar bears lose their habitat and may potentally go extinct in 40 years from now when their status is currently "threatened", hmm?  	31	2

You do realize we have been through 5 ice ages already? Another is coming and that is a fact. The earth goes through cycles... you can bet your sweet ass we will be an ice covered planet once again. The only time climate change will be irreversible is in 5 billion years when the sun becomes a red giant and consumes Mercury and ...boils off all water from earth and destroys our atmosphere.

2017-01-29 14:18:14	Kara Me	HappY Meal I researched how these numbers are calculated for the global temperature and it is anything but accurate. They fudge the numbers to account for areas with no temperature stations, which includes the coldest areas in the Arctic and Antarctic, plus they have less stations now than they did years ago with there being less in rural areas. The stations in cities can show artificial fluctuations to higher numbers than are accurate. As a one day anecdote, I was looking at the record temperatures in my city for one day. The temperature we were at for that day was on par with the norm for this time of year. The record cold for the day was taken in the 1930's, I believe, while the record high of 70 degrees (the norm is in the 50's) was taken in the 1890's. Yep, a temperature about 20 degrees above the norm was taken pre 1900, which is well before any of the "hottest years on record." Read up on how the climate scientists are manipulating numbers and their gs to make things look more drastic than tre. I think that things started in earnest years ago with actual concern and actual belief that the data showed an impending catastrophe. However, after all the hubbub started by Al Gore and his movie, the dire predictions within it did not happen. Then the term had to change from Global Warming to Climate Change to reflect the fact that places are not getting any er and nothing really bad is happening. But by this time, climate scientists had been given a lot of grant money and a lot of attention to do this research, so when the numbers weren't actually showing what they had predicted, they had to fudge things and make it look bad to save their reputations and funds. It is often said that there is a 97% or 99% consensus among scientists that we are experiencing global ing. The actual number is far, far smaller. I cannot recall the exact figure, but I think it was around 30% or less. The jury is still out on this subject. Science has not proven that we are for sure ing or that anything is being caused by man. The sun is the biggest driver of our climate, not greenhouse gases and not people. So why would the sun's activity drive climate throughout all of the Earth's history but suddenly stop doing so now? Think about it and research it. I am waiting to see how things progress before I take a stance of absolute on either side of the debate. There is definitely not enough to convince me that we have a problem, let along a mad-made one.  	20	2
2017-01-29 13:32:23	Alex Siemers	Because right now, at least 80% of global power comes from burning fossil fuels (not too sure how accurate that number is, please correct me). And even without concern for money, clean energy is very  and resources inefficient for power besides nuclear, which has its own set of issues. And more greenhouse gases come from livestock than combustion. So, it's not too easy of a fix  	20	2
2017-01-23 19:15:51	SomeAlanDude	@​ Notice how the record for the hottest year was last year....but the previous record was the year before that..... Lol  	20	2
2017-01-23 18:58:20	Kara Me	 I can't find a source that says that, only one for 2016. It also doesn't state how those numbers are calculated. It's funny that under that article they have a link for a related article that is headlined "Dozens Killed in East Asia January  Snap." lol  	14	1
2017-01-23 16:41:01	Shahid Khan	@ you know 2017 broke the record for the highest temperature ever for January  	36	2
2017-01-23 08:25:18	Kara Me	HappY Meal I do agree that CO2 is at a high since the industrial revolution, but not for the history of the Earth. Considering how cold the Earth was, it is reasonable to assume that there is a lot more contributing to the temperature of the Earth than just one gas, as the media and politicians would have us believe. There is a great focus on CO2 in all conversations regarding climate change and that really needs to be corrected. I have a thought that is pure conjecture, but perhaps as CO2 rises it contributes to raising the overall temperature, but there may be a level at which it starts to have the opposite effect. Just like in people with COPD - when you give them O2 it will help raise their SpO2 levels, but if you give them too much O2 they will retain CO2 and their SpO2 will start to decrease. Maybe that can contribute to an explanation for why it was so cold long, long ago when the CO2 levels were drastically higher than tre now. Just a thought.  	20	2

2017-01-17 03:50:07	Kara Me	HappY Meal arguing semantics about whether CO2 is a pollutant or not is meaningless. Even something that is natural can be a pollutant if there is too much of it. Nice try on weaseling out of that one, but no luck.  	20	2
2017-01-17 03:47:47	SomeAlanDude	I see an error in the link. It does not work for me?  	27	5
2017-01-17 03:42:02	Kara Me	HappY Meal no, it is not an all time high because it has been a LOT higher. That is common knowledge in the climate change research. You must not have looked very hard if you came up with something completely different. Even sites that are pro human caused climate change admit to this fact. Apparently I have to do your work for you.   	20	2
2017-01-17 03:29:48	SomeAlanDude	What i meant to say was CO2 Is not pollution.  	20	2
2017-01-17 03:24:28	SomeAlanDude	@ i never said diesel has nothing to do with CO2.  	20	2
2017-01-17 03:21:12	Kara Me	 yes, although China puts out about double what the US does, so that is not a close second. And diesel puts out more CO2 than gasoline, so I don't see how saying that tre wearing masks because of diesel somehow means that it has nothing to do with CO2. The primary focus of climate change legislation is CO2 emissions, not other greenhouse gases. And I never once said that we should not use renewable energy sources. I said quite the opposite, so you should read more carefully, Happy Meal.  	20	2
2017-01-17 03:13:20	Kara Me	 you cannot make a claim that X amount of CO2 emissions melts X square meters of ice. You cannot back that up. By your numbers, that would mean  alone is melting 16 BILLION square meters of ice every year. That is 2 million square km short of being the entire Arctic ice t. Your numbers are not supportable by reality. Nice try at the enviro-guilt, but it isn't going to work.  	5	6
2017-01-17 03:09:37	SomeAlanDude	@ i have. I found no results. For me it says The glaciation period was low on CO2. but this does not regard to now.  cares about the amount of CO2 during the glaciation period. CO2 right *now* is still at an all time high. You have to agree with me there.  	20	2
2017-01-17 03:06:50	Kara Me	HappY Meal I told you to fact check. It's not hard information to find. You have google just like I do.  	38	5
2017-01-17 02:04:35	SomeAlanDude	@ You are not wrong though. The United States still emits a very Large amount of Carbon Dioxide.  	3	2

2017-01-17 01:56:33	SomeAlanDude	Kara me ive conducted research and it turns out, since the industrial revolution, Co2 emmitions have been rising, and as of 2016 the earth has had the highest recorded global temperature in over the couse of hundreds of thousands of years. If global teperatures kept rising because of green house gasses (notice how i did not mention CO2) the earth would reach a temperature that hasnt been reached in over millions of years. And like you said, in china people are wearing masks. You are right, but keep in mind, the reason why they are wearing the masks if because of burnt diesel fuel in the air. And it is known that diesel fuel causes methylation in the DNA, which is bad. Greenhouse gasses are not pollution CO2 is a natural greenhouse gass. But too much of it is not natural. You basically contradicted yourself by saying we shouldnt switch to renewable sources but you pointed out how bad the condition's are for Chinese people?....Ok  	20	2
2017-01-17 01:50:47	Shahid Khan	But still, my point was to show an example of co2 emit, not compare countries  	2	0

2017-01-17 01:30:00	SomeAlanDude	Ok "sweetie" why dont you show me.  	10	5
2017-01-17 01:08:43	Kara Me	 somehow ns always get the blame for CO2 in the atmosphere. Last I checked it was China that had air so polluted that its citizens are wearing masks and have been told to not even touch the toxic snow. The US is not the problem when it comes to CO2 emissions. You are quite misinformed.  	20	2
2017-01-17 01:06:25	Kara Me	HappY Meal sweetie, I did not pull anything out of my ass. Feel free to check my claims and you will find them to be absolutely accurate. Even those that are pushing human induced climate change admit that the levels of CO2 were far, far higher than tre now. About 6-10+ times higher. Please do fact check that. I would love to see you admit that you don't know what you are talking about.  	20	2
2017-01-17 01:01:43	SomeAlanDude	+ Haha, no problem man.  	25	5
2017-01-17 00:49:22	Shahid Khan	@HappY Meal and thank you so much again, like i said. You're the only one in here with a brain  	38	5
2017-01-17 00:45:55	Shahid Khan	@ you know the average n emits about 16 metric tons of co2 annually and that melts 50 square meter of ice each year. If you add all that up, only the co2 from  melts billions of tons of ice in the arctic each year. That will rise the sea level and the homes for many animals will be lost and that will cause mass extinctions  	31	6
2017-01-17 00:32:52	SomeAlanDude	Also the oceans at at stake through climate change because of ocean acidification. When CO2 dissolves in the ocean it turns into carbonic acid. Resulting to coral bleaching. Coral reefs have half of the oceans biodiversity it coral reefs die, so does the fish that live inside them. If that happenes, fisheries will shut down because tre not catching enough fish to make a profit. Resulting in people loosing jobs and food.  	31	2
2017-01-17 00:23:35	SomeAlanDude	Of couse the sun drives climate change... But its the amount of CO2 that is in the atmosphere Right now that can melt the polar ice caps. I dont care about the glaciation periods because they do not concern us now. Climate change may not concern humans but it certainly concerns the animals that live in the polar ice caps. If polar ice caps melt. Polar bears will die due to habbitat loss. Even is we dont switch to renewable sources, we will eventually run out of coal, oil, and natual gass since it is non renewable and that is a fact conducted by scientific data. Dont be pulling facts out of your ass that CO2 was at its highest during glaciation periods because humans have physically extracted CO2 storages, AND burned them, thus releasing CO2 into the atmosphere.﻿  	31	2

2017-01-16 23:46:53	Kara Me	HappY Meal the media is what is pushing climate change. Why would you be upset at the media when tre pushing your agenda?  	20	2
2017-01-16 23:46:09	Kara Me	HappY Meal the levels of CO2 during periods of glaciation were far, far higher than tre now. The SUN drives climate change far more than CO2. Reducing CO2 will only reduce the global temperature a fraction of a degree over the next 100 years, if the goals the world is setting are met. That fraction of one degree will cost trillions of dollars per year. It simply is not worth it. Of course we should try to move to "greener" energy sources, but it is not a dire need and can be accomplished over a great period of time. We don't need to be setting ridiculous standards that will raise our cost of living and lower our quality of living dramatically. The world cannot be sustained by wind and solar power with the technology that we have today. We need fossil fuels and nuclear power to sustain ourselves. Unless there is some sort of major advance that makes solar and wind power more efficient, then we are stuck with what we have. The world cannot be fed with organic food and cannot be powered with renewable energy sources. That is just reality. Enough with the doomsday scenarios that are never going to happen.  that has been predicted regarding climate change has happened. It started as global ing and when it got colder, they changed it to climate change. It's a joke at this point.  	31	2

2017-01-14 23:53:30	Shahid Khan	@HappY Meal but still, if you listen to those facts, it's common sense, like you have to think something's missing. There must be a reason why they did something. The media won't show you what we did wrong that provoked another country to do something. They just show what the other country did bad to us. Like if you think about it, were the super power of the world, other countries can't do anything bad to us unless we do something bad to them. People don't think like that  	9	2
2017-01-14 23:47:58	SomeAlanDude	@ I never listen to the media. I research on my own if i want to know something on a subject. You are right in terms of the media, but the problem is the gullible people that believe it, and use their facts that they pull out of their ass, to argue against us.  	7	2
2017-01-14 23:44:05	Shahid Khan	@HappY Meal i know but what can you do with s? , they will still listen to people who know nothing. The media has just basically brainwashed most people and they don't even realize it. They think how they want them to thin, they say what the media want them to say or dress or buy or do anything st all  	9	2
2017-01-14 23:39:30	SomeAlanDude	@​ Very true. There is actual scientific data, that supports climate change is actually happening, but doing research is better than just simply denying facts. Burning fossil fuels releases a lot of stored Carbon Dioxide that is within them into the atmosphere, and there is scientific data that confirms it.  	20	2
2017-01-14 23:37:07	Shahid Khan	Like whatever they do, we have to pay for it and the government is all in it. And now that we have trump as president, forget about climate change, they people he has chosen for ary's and stuff, they don't believe in climate change either  	20	2
2017-01-14 23:35:40	Shahid Khan	But obviously we have proven that climate change is real and it is already ducking up our world, us average people can't do anything about it. It's the rich people, their factories burn all the fossil fuel, when they convert to all renewable energy, it would be okay but they won't because that costs money. Remember the saying, it's a rich man's war but a poor man's fight  	20	2
2017-01-14 23:33:25	Shahid Khan	@HappY Meal actually the thing is that people nowadays believe what they hear on tv without doing any research. Like trump said and some other senators said that climate change isn't real so that's why people must be saying climate change isn't real. The problem with us is that we just argue if something is real or not, we should be investigating if it's real or not then take care of it.  	20	2
2017-01-14 23:29:27	SomeAlanDude	@ Haha thanks :)  	25	7
2017-01-14 12:14:23	Shahid Khan	@HappY Meal thank you so much, finally someone has a brain on here  	38	5
2017-01-14 09:10:30	SomeAlanDude	There are facts proving climate change is actually happening. You cant just simply deny them. We are putting more CO2 in the atmosphere than there should naturally be (excluding other greenhouse gasses) through fossil fuels like burning coal and natural gas. There is actual science behind this, thats why its such a big political issue, you cannot deny the facts that this is happening because, this is actually happening. Switching to renewable resources would be the smarter move since they mostly do not produce greenhouse gasses like coal, and waste like nuclear energy. So yes there is more CO2 in the atmosphere than there should naturally be. If this continues, polar ice caps will melt due to the fact that the greenhouse effect produced by these gasses, will raise overall global temperatures, and the earth's temperature does not have to raise that much to cause a big change. This is only one factor that drives climate change. Don't even get me started on the rest.  	20	2
2017-01-14 08:58:53	SomeAlanDude	+Kara me you need to realise that CO2 is not the only factor causing climate change.  	20	2
2017-01-11 14:43:20	cs181181	@ actually if your going to debate how harmful CO2 as a green house gas you should look at the effects of methane caused by livestock. Its just as bad as the CO2 released by our industries.  	20	2
2017-01-09 16:11:53	Shahid Khan	@ I didn't say climate change is the effect of co2, I said today is far more co2 than there ever was.  	20	2
2017-01-09 14:14:36	Kara Me	 correlation and causation are two very different things. Just because the amount of CO2 has increased does not mean that it is the cause of climate change. If you look at the temperature of the Earth over time you can see that it follows solar activity, not the level of CO2. So why would the level of CO2 suddenly drive climate change in a way that it never has before, even at times when it was far higher than it is now? There are some great lectures from the climate change summit that show the fact that there is not a consensus among scientists as to what is causing climate change and how it is or is not affecting the Earth. Lord Monckton does a great job of explaining that. There is a scientist whose name I cannot recall right now who has given some great lectures about sea levels and how tre not rising at all. He shows how scientists have cherry picked data to show a rise from an area where the measurement device has been shown to not be accurate and they use that one measurement to extrapolate for the whole globe. There is a lot of push for legislation to reduce climate change and it has become more of a political issue than a scientific one. It doesn't help that it was started by an alarmist movie that turned out to be science fiction rather than science fact. A lot more research needs to be done before we make more regulations that are going to hurt the economy for a teensy tiny possible environmental gain.  	20	2
2017-01-09 12:42:53	Shahid Khan	@ if you go to meg.org, you'll find "The pre-industrial concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was 280 parts per million (ppm). As of  2016, 404.93 ppm." Carbon dioxide is as twice as much as pre industrial era.  	20	2

2017-01-08 05:11:17	Kara Me	 more CO2 than ever before? Research that long and hard and come back and tell me if you still have the same answer. We have one of the lowest concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere now. There is a certain amount that is absolutely necessary just to sustain life, and we are not that far above that level. There have been periods in history where there was FAR more CO2 in the atmosphere than now, and there is literally no time in history where the CO2 level caused a catastrophic ing, and it isn't happening now either. Not how they stopped calling "global ing" and changed it to "climate change" because they could not support their previous claims that the Earth was ing at an alarming rate. Yes, the climate is changing, but there is not sufficient evidence to say that it is all or partly caused by humans. Research the role the sun plays. Research the fact that oceans have not risen at all. If we reduce CO2 too much we will harm the Earth, not help it.  	20	2

2017-01-08 01:21:22	cs181181	shahid khan. The earth goes through periods of cooling and heating. We have just come out of the last ice age, the ice caps would of melted no matter what we would of done, its natural. Whats not natural is how fast it is going and this leaves us less time as humans to adept, which is why we are so concerned about climate change.  	20	2
2017-01-07 20:52:53	Shahid Khan	 how was it gonna happen? Since the industrial revolution, we already burnt more than 50% of the fossil fuel, green house gases, there is more carbon dioxide than there ever was, our ozone layer is burning, and there's much more. That doesn't happen by itself, somebody does it and we did it. Planet earth is the body, humans are the virus, and global ing is the fever  	20	2

2017-01-07 16:03:17	cs181181	Climate change was always going to happen, we are just added tinder to the fire so its going to happen sooner and  we have to go to sustainable fuels, fossil fuels will not last forever.  	20	2
2017-01-06 09:12:03	Kara Me	 or human pollution wasn't the cause of global ing/climate change. Shocking, I know, but the climate has changed throughout the history of the Earth, long before humans created electricity and started using fossil fuels. The CO2 level has also been dramatically higher than it is now in the past with no ill effects. The change in climate we are seeing is simply not being caused by fossil fuels or even humans. It is part of the natural cycle of the Earth. Literally every doomsday scenario that Al Gore said would happen has not come even close to happening. Even if we cut the CO2 levels to what the governments want, it would potentially change the global temperature by a small fraction of a degree. It's not worth all of the cost and trouble. Sure, we should be working on alternative energy sources that are more sustainable, but to supplement fossil fuels, not replace them entirely (at least until we can make that feasible). There is not such an impending due date that we must do this by. Other sources of energy aside from fossil fuels simply cannot create enough energy to sustain life as it is. No one wants to give up our modern conveniences and there really is no reason to do so. Environmentalists think that everyone should have to sacrifice and suffer to do whatever they want everyone to do. It doesn't work that way. You don't get to dictate how everyone will live their lives. It is bad enough that environmentalists have forced me to spend way longer and be way inconvenienced at the checkout line in stores, and for nothing. Quit thinking that you can legislate people into caring if you want to live that way, be my guest. I will not be joining you. I don't want to and see no reason to. That should be my right in what is supposed to be a free country.  	20	2

2016-12-13 22:13:52	Shahid Khan	 I agree with you. But their thinking is that I will make enough money before fossil fuels run out so my grandchildren can live happily.

2016-12-13 22:11:12	SwagOver 9000	Shahid Ktk Natural resources one day running out is also a thing they do not want to happen. (If they keep using fossil fuels and polluting fresh water sources.) That way, those natural resources would also dramatically increase in money.  	11	2

2016-11-22 18:27:45	SwagOver 9000	Vacuumer100 Yea, it's naive to even think we can't use fossil fuel to keep this world going, but what I'm suggesting is that to keep it to a bare minimum and find an alternative. (I know it's not easy.) People generally keep using energy and don't invest their time to find a solution,in which they should.  	3	2
2016-11-22 18:08:15	TrainNkill	 It's not that simple. Look it up. There's a lot more to it then just changing to solar power. We use a lot of energy. More than solar power can supply. Hopefully in the future it will change.  	11	2
2016-11-22 18:06:05	SwagOver 9000	Vacuumer100 Solar power, if they stop supporting fossil fuel companies and find an alternative. People just need to bear with a more inconvenient life. I don't mean don't use them at all, ONLY WHEN NECESSARY. People use ships and  a lot of times just for entertainment, not for legit reasons. People can get their food by local refreshments rather than food that costs thousands of dollars to ship from the other half of the globe to where they're at. People say they "need it", is it a must? (Sometimes) If this continues, they're just gonna kill the whole Earth off.  	11	2
2016-11-22 09:27:37	Turkish Boii	See i would start a mad and fair conversation to your argument, but some ignorant fucker will just start saying "kill muslims" so all im going to say is, most of our energy comes from fossil fuels, which provides a lot of power, but also pollutes the earth.

2016-11-16 01:47:08	Derek Woodford	Why would the great lakes change? Tre nowhere near the ocean. They would still continue to flow out, so I highly doubt there would be any change at all on the shores of the lakes, just because the caps melt. It's not like there are glaciers that flow in to them or anything like that! Maybe someone out there has more information about that than I do....      If anyone would like to share, I'm all ears.  	5	6

2017-01-06 14:33:21	joe mosleh	climate change will alter the Great Lakes region with more floods and droughts, lower lake levels, less ice cover and more extreme weather events.  	31	6
2017-01-06 07:12:26	Derek Woodford	Lake Ontario is 74 meters above sea level. I don't think there is any expectation the oceans will rise 242 feet. The rest of the lakes are even higher...  	5	3
2017-01-06 02:36:45	Antoine Robinson	As far as I know, the lakes aren't necessarily that high up in elevation, so if sea levels rise it would back up the water flow out of the St.Laurence river (Rip Québec's population centres) and that loss in elevation would back up the lakes as well. same thing for the Mississippi and major  n rivers , the water form the sea would either penetrate the inland rivers or back them up, creating larger bodies of water.  	5	3
2016-12-25 00:28:21	Derek Woodford	I don't think your understanding has that much scientific backing. Especially when it comes to the Great Lakes, 3 of them are far too shallow to be connected to anything underground. I believe the myth tre all connected has something to do with the Loch Ness Monster. Another thing science has a hard time proving the existence of. I'm not down with theories and speculation.  	5	3

2016-11-17 01:45:06	Derek Woodford	I did find this from Michigan government website, "There are no glaciers within hundreds of miles of the Great Lakes today and the ice fields of North  are restricted to isolated mountainous areas of the northwest." Which is more along what I thought. But I've never been there....  	5	6
2016-11-17 01:34:23	Derek Woodford	I honestly had no idea there were still glaciers there. I know the lakes were formed by glaciers, but had no clue there was anything left besides seasonal snowfall.  	5	6
2016-11-16 23:54:48	Unbothered	 The Great Lakes were carved by glaciers hundreds of years ago, and there's still glacial activity in the upper peninsula of Michigan that would totally wipe out parts of Michigan coast if it melted.  	5	6

2016-11-12 22:51:23	danny2078	I think this is a bit dramatic. First off, when ice that is floating in water melts it does not change the water level, only land ice will do that co the entire north ple could melt & the sea level would not change. Only the ice that melts off of a land mass (like Antarctica ) would change the sea level. If the south pole melted the coastlines may change a little, but not this dramatic. we would also gain a ton of new land in Antarctica. I doubt we could melt all of the ice on earth if we tried. Coastlines naturally change , global temperatures naturally fluctuate, Global ing is a hoax.  	31	6

2016-11-12 11:51:41	nicholas scott	1\. As "ing" increases, studies show that Antarctic Ice over land would actually increase. So although technically, a 58m rise in sea level is possible (if all the ice melted), it is highly unlikely. In fact, it seems that the sea level would drop, because of the following:   2\. All sea ice (the entire of the Arctic and all Antarctic sea ice) would make no difference to sea level if it all melted. Worth googling why that is.   3\. More ice would be deposited over the land mass of Antarctica, lowering the free water in the sea, and also pushing Antarctica down further due to the increased weight of the ice, lowering the surrounding seabed, making more room for water. The effect is lower sea levels worldwide.  	5	6

2016-11-13 16:10:28	nicholas scott	@ Antarctic Ice At Record High -  So....the ice isn't really shrinking, is it. I think you just swallowed what you wanted to hear. Many things are counter-intuitive. I understand the sea level rise IF the land ice melts. That would be 58 metres globally. But it won't happen.  	5	6
2016-11-13 16:02:36	mander997 _	@​ the melting happens because the poles are losing more ice in the summer than they gain in the winter. Tre already shriking, but you say there is a point where the shriking stops as the earth keeps ing? That makes no sense. Also much of the current ice is on land so it will increase sea levels around the world when it melts.  	5	6
2016-11-13 07:54:08	nicholas scott	@ As I said, worth googling why ice melting doesn't change the level of water. Which means all sea ice is irrelevant since it will make absolutely no difference whatsoever. As for the land ice - ing is thought to increase the water content of air, meaning more rain and snow. So actually the snow over land will stay as snow. Remember, the antarctic is -85 in winter, we would have to have a temperature rise of 85 degrees for it to START melting. 85 degrees. That's not possible because the oceans would boil first. And yes, scientists reckon more ice over land pushes the land down. You can wiki it all, it's not hidden.  	5	6

Well, ok, but where are your sources?) 1. “Coupling of CO2 and Ice Sheet Stability Over Major Climate Transitions of the Last 20 Million Years" - Scientists analyzed data from a major expedition to retrieve deep marine sediments beneath the Arctic to understand the Paleocene Eocene thermal maximum, a brief period some 55 million years ago of “widespread, extreme climatic ing that was associated with massive atmospheric greenhouse gas input. 2. Published in Geophysical Research Letters, [the study] looked at temperature and atmospheric changes during the Middle Ages. This 2006 study found that the effect of amplifying feedbacks in the climate system-where global ing boosts atmospheric CO2 levels-”will promote ing by an extra 15 percent to 78 percent on a century-scale” 3. Published in Geophysical Research Letters, looked at temperature and atmospheric changes during the past 400,000 years. This study found evidence for significant increases in both CO2 and methane (CH4) levels as temperatures rise. The conclusion: If our current climate models correctly accounted for such “missing feedbacks,” then “we would be predicting a significantly greater increase in global ing than is currently forecast over the next century and beyond”-as much as 1.5°C er this century alone. 4. The Tripati Study for 15 million yrs ago. All the studies more or less say if we don't curtail CO2 emissions, we're probably looking at, over the long term, a return to some of the conditions that existed millions of yrs ago.  havent-been-this-high-for-15-million-years-when-it-was-5-to-10-f-er-and- seas-6f0c210b9cf6#.4nru82of4  	20	2

Due to the new water areas new currents will form and many old currents will change their course which will lead to global sea ecosystem failure. And the planet will continue to  even more because of runaway green house effect which will lead to rivers and lakes drying up and also no clouds will form so no fresh water for agriculture. There will be extreme droughts and extreme winters. No food will be there and forest will die too and soon no oxygen and we will become moderate .... and the best part its late... not too much but the runaway effect has started.  	31	2

2016-11-05 19:43:45	Boxspite	Looks like Russia would be the only superpower in the world that would benefit in the world after all the ice have melted. Not only will the Siberian permafrost retreats into higher latitudes, the Russians would have more land to farm, plus they will have a larger coastline in the Baltic, and Im sure the Baltic States would capitulate all to Russia after most of this states are underwater.      Russia will lose St. sburg and Vladiavostok but thats nothing compared to how China and the US will lost their eastern coasts (since most of China and US industrial bases are both in the Eastern coasts). Not to mention, a quarter of Ukraine is wiped out, Denmark is wiped out, a quarter of Sweden is wiped out, more than half of  is gone, a third of the UK is gone, a quarter of France is wiped out - looks like Moscow is the only capital in the world that remains above the surface.  	31	6

2016-11-08 13:38:08	Boxspite	@ Look, all the ice has melted already, the planet may  up a little bit more but its too late to do anything. I bet, after all the ice had melted many would rethink about how they will deal with the new world. Maybe some people would build countries in Antarctica or  after the ice has resided and the land becomes fit for habitation. And its not CO2 that you should really think if we talk about retreating permafrost in  and Siberia - instead you should think of tapping previously untappable natural gas. Under the permafrost, trillions of tons of natural gas and oil are waiting for humans to dig them out.  	31	6

2017-01-27 00:53:10	Gratowl	+j escoti No he isn't. He just started, and he was already liked enough to get into office. Some sources claim his approval rating is as high as 57%, by the way; it's way too early to call. And if you think illegals can't commit voter fraud with all the shit we give them, then you can't be helped. Some places don't even ask for a driver's license, I assume California's one of them. We all know they _"can't"_ vote; there's a lot of things people _"can't"_ do, but they do them anyways. Voter fraud is certainly much more likely than the Russians hacking the elections.  	20	5
2017-01-26 22:42:05	j escoto	^^^ False. undocumented people cannot vote. That BS is part of Trumps #AlternativeFacts lmfao. He's so hurt the majority of ns dislike him.  	38	5
2017-01-26 04:25:07	Gratowl	+j escoti *_"he's been named the most unpopular president in us history so far."_* It's been 1 week, dumbass. And could easily have been a biased source. Besides, half the shit you just ed about sounds either positive or false. *_"He's been in office for a couple days and done this shit already???"_* Yes. He's doing a great job so far. Fuck Obamacare, and women should go buy their own contraceptives. Also, fuck NAFTA. Even much of the left thought that was a bad deal. *_"since everyone likes so much why'd he lose the popular vote?"_* Retarded inner city liberals. There's reasons the non-big city counties made the electoral map look like a Verizon comercial.  	38	5

"give the man a chance" ... umm... he already has signed to not give funds to services that help get contraceptives/ sex ed etc to women. that will increase the percentage of abortions mind you. he's pulling the US out of nafta. Wait until our grocery prices skyrocket. He already made buying a house that much hard for middle class buyers. The states that voted for him have the highest percentages of people that have Obamacare and he's going to repeal that. He's been in office for a couple days and done this shit already???  	31	5

And only half the US population voted because they were so uninspired by both candidates. So basically less than a quarter of the US population put Trump into office. Pretty lame and pathetic. , you get what you get. Unfortunately, the rest of the world will suffer the consequences too.  	20	2

2017-02-02 14:55:25	DutchStudent1982	+ Dil, je bent goed geindoctrineerd, laat me je wat onderwijzen : Er is geen broeikaseffect, die term is lang geleden al losgelaten door wetenschappers, er  nu gesproken van klimaatverandering. Denk aan het weer, het is onmogelijk om het weer van morgen 100% correct te voorspellen, laat staan dat we in staat zijn de effecten van klimaatfactoren over decennia of zelfs eeuwen juist te voorspellen, er zijn gewoonweg teveel onzekere factoren, het enige dat we kunnen zeggen "het is aan het veranderen" op welke manier, dat weten we nu nog niet, en een verandering is niet op alle gebieden van de aarde dus hetzelfde. Dat de mens invloed heeft op die verandering, daar is men het wel over eens, maar over hoeveel, daar verschillen de meningen over. Er zijn namelijk ook hele grote externe invloeden sommige weten we, maar mogelijk zijn er nog veel ontdekt, hieronder een paar voorbeelden : -we zijn te laat voor een ijstijd (maar dan praten we over eens per 100.000 jaar) als die inzet, kunnen alle zorgen over klimaatverandering overboord. -er zijn periodes van meer en minder zonneactiviteit, over enkele eeuwen, de laatste periode van weinig activiteit zorgde voor de kleine ijstijd van de 16e tm 19e eeuw , die zorgde voor veel honger, mislukte oogsten, het uitsterven van de afstammelingen van de vikings op groenland, etc, mensen kunnen slecht tegen een paar graden kouder. Waar het aan het einde van de romeinse tijd (1e tm 4e eeuw) en de vroege vikingtijd (9e tm 11e eeuw) we een opbloeing zien niet alleen in die beschavingen maar mondiaal, een paar graden er valt dus vaak samen met de bloeitijd van beschavingen, mensen kunnen een paar graden er WEL goed handelen. De opklimmende curve die begon aan het einde van de kleine ijstijd (rond 1850) valt dus samen met de "klimaatverandering" tis de vraag hoeveel ervan veroorzaakt  door het herstellen van de zon naar zijn normale activiteit, als de zon opeens weer besluit actiever/inactiever te en kan dat zomaar +/- 2-5 graden schelen op aarde -stof in de atmosfeer, de tweede wereldoorlog had niet zomaar koude winters, al dat extra stof in de atmosfeer blokkeerde zonlicht, ook de natuur deed dit toen de krakatoa uitbarsten hadden we dat jaar geen zomer, en zelfs de bescheiden uitbarsting van de vulkaar op ijsland zorgde mondiaal voor een afkoeling van enkele tiende graden voor een aantal maanden. De afkoeling door stof is zeer groot, dit is ook wat men ervaard bij een "nucleare winter""zou er een atoomoorlog komen. -methaangas, ook wel bekend als aardgas, dit is een veel groter broeikasgas dan co2, als een grote pocket van methaangas zou ontsnappen bvb door een aardbeving zou dat ineens grote gevolgen hebben -natuurlijk co2 (laat je niet gekmaken, de hoeveelheid co2 die de mens verspreid tenopzichte van wat de natuur doet is marginaal) bij vulkaanuitbarstingen komen e hoeveelheden co2 vrij, dit is ook waar het co2 dat voor de e periode van het Perm zorgde vandaan kwam, een lange periode (zo'n 10.000-30.000 jaar) van hoge vulkanische activiteit (meer dan 10 uitbarstingen per jaar) -grote pockets natuurlijk co2 : zeewater slaat co2 op, water heeft die eigenschap, en veel  in pockets op de bodem van de oceaan opgesloten, echter als het te   komt dat allemaal in een keer vrij, en dat gaat om enorme hoeveelheden, hier en daar zie je dat effect al als opeens een meer of zee gaat "koken" -in de tundra ligt veel co2 opgeslagen in de vorm van turf, als dat ontdooit gaat het rotten en dat geeft VEEL meer co2 dan de olie en kolenindustrie, (de tuinaardeindustrie draagt door het afgraven van deze tundra voor de productie ervan stevig bij aan de co2 uitstoot, denk daar eens aan als je met plantjes planten groen bezig denkt te zijn) -zeestromingen en windstromingen, er gaat te van de evenaar via zee en windstromingen naar de polen, terwijl circulaire stromingen de kou gevangen houd op de polen, deze kunnen verstoord en door klimaatverandering, rivieren veranderen hun bedding ook wel eens en heel soms besluit water opeens aan een heel andere kant de berg af te stromen. dat werkt voor deze rivieren van water en wind niet heel anders. zonder deze stromingen zou het in nederland gezien de breedegraad waar wij op liggen een stuk kouder zijn en op de polen een stuk er, de zuidpool was nog relatief  met beperkte begroeing op sommige gebieden tot wel 12.000 jaar geleden, het ontstaan van de ringstroming die de kou er gevangen houd, versnelde de ijsgroei, en maakt het daar zoveel kouder dus nee ik ben geen klimaatontkenner, maar ik acht de invloed van de mens op deze verandering in het licht van deze grote factoren marginaal. (het effect wat wij hebben op de biotoop daarintegen is vreselijk, en daar zouden we dan ook beter onze aandacht op richten, effecten die OOk veroorzaakt en met de voor de groene economie zo noodzakelijke aardmetalen, en natuurlijk hebben verkeerde methodes van olie, gas en kolenwinning zoals fracking ook enorme nadelige effecten op de biotoop) al die co2 praatjes nemen niet weg dat alle olie, kolen en gas ooit door iemand verbrand zullen en, als niet door deze generatie en dit land, dan wel door een volgende in een ander land. Daarnaast, door zelf minder te gebruiken verlaagd de prijs van dergelijke brandstof wat het alleen maar weer aantrekkelijker maakt voor anderen waardoor het gebruik weer toeneemd. het maakt dus derhalve niet uit of je een ontkenner of erkenner bent van klimaatverandering, we kunnen beter ons geld investeren in de GEVOLGEN van klimaatvarandering, dan in de co2 hetze. Groene energie heeft ook zin, om economisch voorbereid te zijn op de toekomst, maar de verkeerde investeringen en daarin gedaan, die co2 normen van brussel schaden dus ook de bestendigheid van onze economie. Totale ONZIN (meteen mee stoppen) : Biodiesel, landbouw kost meer energie dan het produceerd, die bijmengingen is dus totaal zinloos. Windenergie, er is enorm veel energie nodig om de materialen ervoor te maken, en het delven van de grondstoffen ervoor leverd ook nog eens veel vervuiling, tel dan nog eens de energie om ze te plaatsen, en je ziet dat ze vaak niet eens de energie opleveren die ze kosten om neer te zetten over hun levensduur. Zonneenergie, door middel van zonnepanelen, is een van de meest vervuilende energiemethodes die er is, doordat ervoor zeldzame grondstoffen nodig zijn die vooral in china op ENORM vervuilende wijze gewonnen en. Elektrisch rijden/accu's : ook hiervoor geld, de accu's nodig om dit te faciliteren vragen grondstoffen die zeer schaars zijn, en alles behalve duurzaam gewonnen kunnen en. Spaarlampen : hoewel energiezuinig, zijn het gewoon tl-buizen in een andere vorm en bevatten enorm giftige stoffen, zowel productie, gebruik, als verwerking ervan kost veel meer energie en veroorzaakt meer vervuiling dan dan de traditionele lamp. Nuclear : het produceren van brandstofstaven kost enorm veel energie, de winning van uranium uit erts nog veel meer, hierdoor leverd een nucleaire centrale een negatief energierendement op, en dan heb ik het nog niet eens over ontploffingsgevaar en Wat WEL zin heeft : *zonnespiegeltorens (traditionele stoomturbine aangedreven door geconcentreerd zonlicht via spiegels, goed te plaatsen op lokaties met veel zon en weinig neerslag, zoals in de sahara) *waterkrachtcentrales (al meer dan 100 jaar een van de meest betrouwbare energiemethodes, weinig energie nodig, veel rendement, nadeel is wel dat daarvoor een hoop mensen moeten verhuizen en natuurgebieden onder water komen te staan) *alternatieve windmolens (van het type wat als een spiraal omhoog gaat, die in verhouding veel minder materiaal nodig hebben om te plaatsen en niet naar de wind hoeven te draaien) *geothermale centrales (van het type zoals gebruikt in ijsland, er zijn nog wel andere afgelegen locaties die ervoor geschikt zouden zijn) *magnetisch onderlegde snelwegen (de techniek van draadloos opladen), zodat eletrische auto's kunnen rijden zonder behoefde aan grote accu's. *ligfietsen, in coconvorm, mits goed gebouwd kun je daarmee 50 tot 70km/h halen, ruim voldoende voor een groot deel van het persoonlijk transport, alleen is stoppen en weer vertrekken er lastiger mee als op traditionele fietspaden het geval is, dus aanleg van speciale fiets-snelwegen zou ervoor vereist zijn. *een waterstofeconomie kan ook helpen, er zijn redelijk botsingbestendige tanks voor, hoewel het geen energie opleverd, hoeft er integenstelling tot biodiesel niet ook nog eens landbouwgrond voor opgeofferd en, terwijl het wel voldoet aan de vraag naar een energie- compacte en mobiele brandstof, daarnaast met magnetisch onderlegde snelwegen heb je maar een klein tankje ervan nodig, genoeg om naar/van de snelweg te rijden. *de luchtvaart zal ws als enige bio-kerosine of alcohol blijven gebruiken, waterstof en vliegen is niet de veiligste combinatie, niet een ideale oplossing. En voor de toekomst : *kernfusiereactoren zijn mogelijk iets voor de toekomst, iig iets om onderzoek naar te blijven doen, eigenlijk is het meer het gat overbruggen tot we de energie-rendabel kernfusie kunnen doen. *ium-Zout reactoren zin een dood spoor, maar zijn minder gevaarlijk en leveren een beter rendement op dan de traditionele kerncentrales, onderzoek hierin ligt dichterbij een energie-rendabele oplossing. mogelijk een optie om het gat tussen het einde van olie en het begin van kernfusie op grote schaal te overbruggen.  	31	5
2017-02-02 14:43:58	DutchStudent1982	+ van der Beek dat ga je ook niet meemaken. + Dil en het duurt VEEL langer dan 40 jaar. de meeste wetenschappers gaan van een temperatuurstijging van 4-6 graden uit tussen nu en het jaar 2100. dat is genoeg om de noordpool voor 6 maanden per jaar ijsvrij te laten zijn (er is nu al nauwelijks ijs meer op de noordpool in de zomer) maar groenland en de zuidpool blijven dan grotendeels onaangetast. een zeer bescheiden stijging van iets meer dan een halve meter wereldwijd (en ws maar een paar cm in nederland) de meest pessimistisch ingestelde onder de wetenschappers gaan uit van een temperatuurstijging van 9-11 graden tussen nu en het jaar 2100 dat is genoeg om de noordpool 9 maanden per jaar ijsvrij te laten zijn EN de volledige ijskap van groenland te laten smelten. en de zeespiegel 2 meter te laten stijgen, maar dat is een gemiddelde, sommige landen zullen veel meer stijging krijgen, anderen minder. Iin nederland zal zelfs dan de stijging marginaal zijn of waarschijnlijk zelfs een lichte daling inhouden (de bodem van groenland  omlaag gedrukt door al dat ijs en daarom nederland ook, als dat ijs weg is, "veren" we dus omhoog, wat die stijging compenseerd) Maar zelfs in dit doom-scenario blijft de zuidpool stijf bevroren. ALS de zuidpool smelt zal dat niet voor ver na de volgende eeuwwisseling zijn, dus AL het ijs weg, gaan we voorlopig niet meemaken, en waarschijnlijk nooit.  	31	5

2017-01-28 11:10:23	greengorillah	There is one factor you are not mentioning. The Netherlands are not an island, global ing could have devastating effects on many other parts of the world causing a global economic meltdown, hunger, wars and a refugee crisis of unseen proportions. All that would also have an effect on the Netherlands and its economy. Now you might be pretty accurate on some of the other points, but luckily none of us can look into the future, I hope there will be some factors balancing climate change as it is currently predicted.  	31	2

2017-01-11 20:10:13	DutchStudent1982	nah we would be fine. -first the nothpole would melt, it would have little to no effect on sea levels for us but it would have large climatic effects for us due cold polar winds no longer trapped in the north, and different ocean currents, we would have much more extreme weather, we might get colder winters and hurricanes in summer, and other extreme weathertypes like mutch larger hail, moussoun type rainsstorms and generally even more wind (and we already have a lot of wind and rain here) (while I would embrace the ice, since we haven't had a good winter in almost 2 decades, the rest of that extreme weather does not sound to properly, but given our high technological and economic society, we will just adapt, some old buildings may suffer but we'll develop new architect styles and methods to combat it, like we always have) -second the greenland icecaps would melt, while that does add 2m to global sea levels, for us it would cause a little more than halve a meter sea level DROP, due the weight of that icecap pressing the land down, and it will bounce up once that ice is gone. Also less ice would probably mean a little er climate, netherlands would get summers like south of france, winters like scandanavia and a lot of golfball-sized hailstorms, the average windspeed would rise from 4 to 7, and storms of force 10 would increase from 3 times a year to 5 times a month, and winds of force 11 that we now have only once a decade we would have about once month 12 that we now call storm of the century we would have 1 or two a year off. Add to this a couple of tornado's, and moussoun like rains... our biggest problem would not be the sea.. it would be the rivers... all that extra rain through our river delta means we would have to dig the rivers a lot deeper and widers, adaptations we already are making (controlled giving land back to the riverdelta, planned flood area's so we can prevent more valueble area's from flooding, and ofcourse stronger river dykes. So it would probaly involve a second deltaworks but we would manage, many poor nations by now would have deathtolls in the millions however as they would have much higher sea level rises (some as much as 8m) and not the funds to combat the new situation. -third the atlantic sea ice would melt, adding about 4m of sea levels, but again it would not spread out evenly, sea's have mountain ridges and vallays too, earth is not a perfect sphere and water does not distribute evenly. For us it would result in about 2-3M of sea level rise, combined with the reduction we already had from greenland, thats still a solid 2.5m sea level rise compared to now However we can still combat that, many of our nation is already 5m or more below sea level and some area's as much as 15m below sea level.. so adding 2.5m would not be a problem, we can raise the dykes. It would however have bad effects on nature and agricultre. While Zeeland, and Groningen and Friesland are mostly protected from the north sea with dykes, north and south holland mostly still rely on the dunes. These dunes would suffer During high tides and storms sometimes parts of the dunes get washed away.. and we maintain these natural defences to prevent them from eroding away over time. Special plants keep grip on the sands, and underwater dykes placed some 100m off the coast (called wave-breakers) block most of the energy from the sea, along with sandbanks (some artificcial) that perform this same task. A 2.5m sea level rise would in itself not be that bad for the dunes, but together with stronger storms (that would come with a world without ice and higher temperatures due more heat = more energy = more storms/severe weather) it would mean the deathblow to the dunes, we could build dykes there too and we would, but it would be the deathblow to our famous unspoiled dutch beaches, and a lot of nature would suffer due the dunes being a large nature preserve for many species, it would be a loss to culture, felt deeply as many can never again visit the beach the way they can now, and taking a walk through the dunes would be history. most of our waddeneilanden would be gone as well and waddenlopen (walking from behind the seadykes during low tide to our offshore wadden-island over the sandbanks that fall dry during lowtide) will no longer be possible. An economic loss would be felt too, as the higher sealevels would push salt water in the ground... even with dykes... it would mean that a lot of our agricultural land would become less fertile at at the very least to wet to use for the current crops, the flower-festifals of the zaanstreek, much of the agriculture there, it would chance or disapear. Our greenhouse agriculre works without soil more and more so it would survice, were it not the hailstorms and more severe weather making that ever more difficult too, but perhaps with bulletproof or reinforced glass? So while we would survice this, it would reduce our economy by 15-20%, and making us ever more dependant on food imports, in a world were food would become ever more a problem. On the plus side we would have a ton of fresh water, in a world where that would become quite se.. we would be like the new oil bs... dealing in fresh water, that could compensate for our losses. We could win the markerwaard back from the sea to increase agricultural yields, but that would come at a severe effect to many unique annimal and plant species, and for this reason we did not do this even when it was planned in the flevowerken that created the provice flevoland. Desperate times, but seeing how the dunes would be gone and many annimal and plant spieces with it, it would be a hard debate, screw nature over even more, or risking the people to starve.. So overall we would pretty much survive, we would have to give up little land, but our economy, culture and ecology would take a pretty bloody nose -fourth the big one the melting of the LANDBASED ice on the south pole. (this would require a LARGE rise in global temperatures to be feasable, as in 10 degrees or more, much more than for the other effects) But if it happend, yep we would be screwed... were we lucked out in 1-3, this one would hit us actually harder than global average sea level rises... +11-13m It would mean we would have to quadruplle the average dyke hight... and that means the base would need to be insanely wide.. it would be like the dutch economy trying to pull off the apollo project single handingly.. to large even for our budget. Than again most of our cultural city's and most of our population and most of our economy is located near the coast. But building that dyke would also make the land even more soggy and silty, wrech even more havoc on groundwater saltyness, make the river-flow even harder.. and be a disaster waiting to happen in the light of terrorist attacks or megastorms that now will be very common. -it can not be know what stance the dutch will take, will we ruin our national dept and economy and call deux est on the water and build that MEGADYKE in the 20 years orso we have to do it, building in an alarming rate keeping up with the gradual 11m rise over that period? -or do we pull back and give up halve our nation, cutting the number of provinces back to 8 and sacrifice 90% of our cultural herritage, and 70% of our economy while repopulating 80% of our population AND building a new seadyke and pick a new capitol.. we would become quite a tiny nation and even more densely populated. (keep in mind iaround 2060 over halve our population will be of foreign origine and might not have the same desire to save our herritage at all cost) -or will we do what dutch always do, go both ways, and sacrifice about a third of our nation but still build part of the megadyke but shorter to save at least part of our cultural herritage, along with some repopulation and breaking down and rebuilding brick by brick the most important historical buildings. We will survive though even THAT disaster.. but we would most likely suffer such an economic and cultural blow, we would be basicly be back to where we were after ww2, in ruins. than again.. in a world all suffering these effects and in need of rebuilding.. it helps to be the master of battling water in the world... perhaps we could earn back our wealth that way. we might become a second world country.. and reduced in size and lost a lot.. but we will hang on.  	31	3

2016-10-23 06:09:43	joskemom	This is what a video looks like when the makers of the video don't know science. A simple review of buoyancy and water displacement will show you that if an ice berg melts, the sea level remains the same. If the ice ts melt, there is no effect on sea level because the water that runs off the 'melting' ice t fills the void of water that was displaced. In other s, the volume of area the ice t fills will be replaced with the water from that 'melted' ice t. Al Gore made a whole movie about 20 foot rise in sea levels because he did not know what the hell he was talking of. This GW hoax is scientifically challenged.  	31	6

2016-10-10 03:37:34	guyinmorton	Does anyone take into account that much of the Earth's ice is floating? Floating ice displaces the amount of water it is made of and therefore will not add to the volume of liquid water. The overall effect wouldn't be as drastic as shown. I'm not sure that all of the land based ice if melted would make such a drastic change. Dividing the cubic mileage of all land based ice into the total square mileage of the ocean/water surface area? A few feet maybe?  	5	6

2017-01-02 19:19:00	Sol Rosenberg	You mean man made global ing isn't real.  and other planets heated up as well, did not know earth polution affected the solar system, lol. I for one am looking forward to greenland becoming green again and not ice covered. Global ing periods and global cooling periods are a very natural cycle. When greenland was named, we had farming going on in greenland before the last ice age. Now we are coming out of the ice age and things will go back to the way it was when greenland was named until the next ice age that once again brings back the ice covered lands like tre today. But yes, for many that is way to hard to understand. Those vikings obviously were much bigger polluters than we are today. We should totally carbon tax them extra. That will fix it. Lmfao  	20	2
2016-12-23 22:31:15	Miguel Juarez	@***** Well each year it is increasing because of pollution. In Mexico, the water level is increasing about 2-3 inches every year. It may not be that much but it is increasing so it could increase to 3-4 and then to 5-6.  	33	3
2016-12-21 05:02:30	Miguel Juarez	Global ing is basically the world heating up to higher and higher temperatures because of pollution. The high temperatures cause more ice to melt and sea levels to rise.  	20	2

2016-10-09 00:43:11	Hoschi0913	is plate tectonics calculated into this ?   and i call bullshit on that one right away, because , as far as we know, does NOT have any ice in the middle of the continent, sooooo HOW can there be a huge lake forming, when it is as dry as the Sahara ?   plus i did some math ( t common core math ) on that one, so please bare with me for a little.......   now what i did, was to calculate the volume of earth ( a sphere ) with an average distance ( diameter ) from side to side, after that i added 60 meter ( 0.0745454 miles, times 2 because earth is a sphere, so both sides gets the 60 meters ) and calculated the new volume, then i subtracted the smaller from the bigger and i had the volume needed or raise of the ocean by 60 meters in cubic miles......   so here is what it looked like....   the regular volume of earth comes out to   2 076 004 759 792.3 cubic miles   with the 60 meter ( times 2 for both sides since it is a sphere )   2 076 063 438 385.5 cubic miles   now subtract the regular from the added and it comes to   58 678 513.2 cubic miles   now since we know that Antarctica has about 5.2 million cubic miles of ice and  roughly about 5 million cubic miles of ice, that makes a total of lets just say 11 million cubic miles of ice......   raises the question   where do the rest of the 47 million cubic miles of ice come from to fill the gap ?   oh and keep im mind, that ice looses about 4% in volume when it changes to the liquid stage, which is quiet a feat for Antarctica since the average Temperatur there is -52.2 F and as we know ice melts at 30-32 F, it might just take a while to get there Temperatur wise !!  	31	6

2016-10-07 21:02:15	bbrickell1	This will never happen! God promised Noah that He would never flood the world again and put the rainbow in the sky as a sign of His promise. However, the Bible does predict that the world will be burned in the future as a form of clearing for a remodeling of the surface of the earth in God's perfect kingdom to come. The question is: are you prepared for that coming kingdom? If not, you can be, but only Jesus can save you from the disaster that's to come. Ask Him into your life today. It will change you for eternity.  	31	1

2016-09-17 18:18:15	J7	As if this would ever happen. Antarctica will never melt, literally not in a million years. The Antarctic current is too strong. There is a reason ice in Antarctica is growing year after year. The only rising sea levels that could concern us would be  melting. Melting sea ice does not even have the smallest effect on sea levels, only land ice would. However,  has not been melting at a very concerning rate at all recently.  	5	6

2016-12-02 15:03:17	Forexalised	Meanwhile, most countries have their big cities in areas that will flood, causing a massive population and housing crisis we will never have seen before.

2016-09-12 11:28:15	Robusti09	I URGE you to look in to what  Beckwith((He is an Part-time professor in climatology; working on Ph.D. in abrupt climate change. Engineering and physics background with a varied experience base including product management and organization, teaching, and research (academic and corporate)) has to say about the issue and, if you find his knowledge&information valuable enough, act on it. The Earth is in a state of abrupt climate change and this has been the case for decades. It is semantic&absurd to debate when we hit the tipping point, as the climate is too complex chaotic system to have any realistic estimate to that.

2016-09-10 05:30:30	Andrew F. Nelsen	Yes, congratulations. Human live near water. It's what we do. When the water level falls we build our shit closer. When it rises we abandon it and move to higher ground. As a species we've been doing this for at least the last 10,000 years. (Since the glaciers receded and the current Ice Age entered a  period.) And we'll continue doing it until we cease to exist as a species.  	33	3

2017-01-01 04:49:22	Alba Gu Bràth	@IISAMII Yes, you're stupid beyond belief. Plenty of relevant facts in my previous posts but you're to thick to remember that aren't you? And I ain't gonna keep repeating them over to you as you're clearly showing quite visible signs of retardation. Face it ..... you know England is fucked and you simply can't handle it. You just want to live in denial while arrogantly still trying to claim the moral high ground. Don't be a lazy stupid cunt all your life and go read the relevant documentation instead of getting others to do the leg work for you. I mean.... are you 'that' stupid that you'd rather not see it first hand in black and white but hear it second hand from a stranger??? Go educate yourself for once you dumb prick.  	37	5

2017-01-01 01:59:33	Orange Pepe	Clearly you need education as well then, as you don't realise when we leave the EU we leave as the UNITED KINGDOM, if Scotland wanted to stay in, you would have to win another independence referendum (highly unlikely), get sorted as a country first, then reapply - which the EU has already said would take years, and Scotland would have to adopt the euro. But yeah, good luck on your imaginary 'ish Pound' working out, whatever the hell that currency is.  	33	1

2016-12-30 14:31:24	Alba Gu Bràth	@ Oh... well done you!! You managed to blurt out two s in succession. Was it difficult for you widdle boy? Yeah....truth hurts doesn't it . Scotland subsidises, and has subsidised England for decades and the truth is that Westminster are absolurely shit scared of losing us, or realistically, our oil and gas reserves. England speaks only for herself, not for Scotland, Wales or Ireland..... and that's why it's time to cast off you parasitic, leeching cunts once and for all. Looks like all your mates, Europe and Britain have fallen out with you lot big time and we're going to take our ball back. Enjoy your new found lonelyness when you 'brexit' hard, soft, clean or otherwise cause none of us give a fucking shit anymore. Lmfao.😅  	24	2

2016-12-27 11:31:22	Alba Gu Bràth	Holy fuck!! You are dumber than I thought. This is beyond a joke and you are an incompetent fool. "Oil is worthless," "subsidised by england," "cannot stand on our own." Roflmfao.😂 You're thicker than the shit I just flushed away you English knobhead. Oil is the biggest revenue producer Britain has and is ish. The ish food and drink industry is the second biggest revenue producer in Britain. The gas revenues produced are the third biggest... our steel industry was the world's best until thatcher tried to kill it because she couldn't have Scotland being better than England oh no. SNP have kick started that back into life. They (SNP) also only have a defecit, you thick cunt because Westminster cut our funding, partly as punishment for daring to have a referendum and partly because you lying English cunts broke the promises made after the fact. Scotland would absolutely be able to stand on her own two feet even without the oil so try all you want with your imperial unionist bollocks cause it's all bullshit rhetoric from the mind of an already defeated enemy. Remember one thing you stupid English prick, any subsidies that Scotland gets is from ish oil and gas and whiskey manufacturing in the first place that England is leeching/ stealing from us and giving us, in relative terms, a pitance of that money back compared to how much you southern wankers spend on yourselves. Fact! And who gives a fuck about spain? Have you seen their trade figures? Have you seen the figures relating to their economy. We'd gain by not having a trade agreement with them because they're going to need bailed out like Greece was. As for the having to re-apply, ten years bullshit..... it's already a known fact that because of your tory masters causing this Brexit fiasco (embarrassing beyond s) Scotland will be allowed almost immediate entry (two years max) as we're being dragged out of something our 'whole country' (Scotland) voted against!!! Think you better go read the Barnett formula again little English  and read what it says as a pose to regurgitating your opinion of what it says. The bare fact is that you English cunts just cannot handle the thought that Scotland and it's people are better than you and would be a far better country without you, financially and otherwise. Go look up what Harold  (another English tory wanker) was saying about Scotland's oils back in the sixties and how they made it top . Because they knew even then, that without ish oil, England was fucked, and you've been living in fear of this day ever since.  	31	2
2016-12-27 10:49:29	EmceeDoctorB	 I have read your bollocks now for what feels like an ice age. You really are one of Wee Princess y's brainwashed useful s, aren't you? Have you even heard of the Barnett Formula? You know, the government policy that ensures that Scotland gets massive subsidies from Westminster. How about the £16bn budget deficit caused by the SNPs financial incompetence that has to be subsidised by England, you want to talk about that? How about the fact that the EU has already said that if you did get independence then you would have to apply for membership like everyone else and there would be no fast tracking meaning at least 10 years before you got in. And even then Spain would block you. How about the fact that Scotland has a population of 5m, of which only 2m are of working age and of those 2m around 500k are employed by the government. Simple maths means that you cannot stand on your own, you don't have the economy to do it and the oil won't bail you out as it is pretty worthless these days.  	31	2
2016-12-27 03:21:19	Orange Pepe	The ish pound isn't it's own currency, it's all GBP. Dear oh dear, and you have the nerve to call me thick. Also I didn't read the rest because I don't have time and it looks like mostly nationalist waffle.  	35	5
2016-12-27 01:28:36	Orange Pepe	leeching' coming from a country that drains our economy from all it's benefits claimants. I seriously hope you get your independence, I mean you are a pretty insignificant country, and contribute very little to the UK in terms of population, taxes and other things. You don't even have a currency plan for what you would do if you did go independent lmfao, that's looking like a really good economy already  	24	1

They pretend that the english aare ll so evil despite the fact they were hundreds of years ago and may were in fact intigated by scotland for example scotlands capital Edinburgh and plenty other parts of scotland were English before the scottish invaded them scots are no even native to scotland like the scots try to make out to outsiders.  	30	1

Because if you were, you'd have been aware that Northern Ireland, along with Eire, don't want anything to do with England but instead want independence too. As for the childish remark you made about Scotland not being noticed when gone.... We'll see how much we aren't noticed when you English wankers have to live without our northsea oil revenues, our northsea gas revenues, our food and whiskey revenues (second biggest revenue producer in Britain and second only to ish oil and gas) etc etc. The very fact that you arrogant English pricks cannot handle the absolute truth that ish oil and gas has been subsidising you southern knobs for the past 50 years because without it, you will be a has been player in the world market. And you can take your nuclear missile stockpile and store them in your beloved land where, for a change, we Scots can not give a shit if there's a little nuclear accident because it'll only affect you soft gay cunts. All you deserve really. Let's see what the next few years brings and how England will just rot away further without our help, nay, lifesaving money that England has been stealing for decades. I'll maybe even take a drive down to your house just so's I can laugh right in your stupid English face. Prick!!  	31	2

2016-08-31 16:26:16	Grant Miller	As much as i believe that we need to focus on environmental issues, this is not one. Water level is not and will not be rising in any substantial amount. Ice melting does not cause water to rise because ice has a greater volume than water; when the ice melts the volume of water in which the floating ice displaced is perfectly replaced keeping the water levels unchanged. The arctic caps contain no land ensuring that water level will not rise due to arctic caps melting. Though there still is Antarctica which is a land mass, however ice has actually been expanding greatly in the south pole reaching all time records in recent years. The ice of Antarctica melting is the only way to significantly raise water levels, and according to recent patterns this is not something we have to worry about.  	31	6
2016-11-29 13:39:55	Grant Miller	Undercoverkidz the number of molecules doesn't solely determine volume. When water freezes, it expands. It's basic science 101. If you don't believe me put a full water bottle in your freezer. You won't forget after you clean all the ice out of your freezer.  	33	6

All that indicates is they can't even be honest about the data.  is there is no reliable way to make measurements accurate enough to support or refute their claims. We're awash in a sea of falsified and meaningless data. None of which is supported by any observed changes of climate itself. Climate has not given any indication of chang beyond it's normal variation. Furthermore nothing they have proposed will lower the amount of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere now or in the future. It's a scam.  	20	2
2016-11-21 10:53:08	Horrible WWI Italian General	Antarctica is losing land ice as a whole, and these losses are accelerating quickly. Here's a discussion that prove that your comment is wrong:  tl;dr it's a controversial report with many error in the research techniques  	5	6
2016-11-21 03:26:00	Patrick Weaver	Land ice is decreasing in west Antarctica and increasing in east Antarctica. Overall the total volume of ice, both sea and land is increasing. That's no surprise it's a natural fluctuation. This idea that everything is caused by man made climate change is nonsense. Also the sea ice is thickening not just expanding.  	5	6
2016-11-21 02:47:48	Horrible WWI Italian General	@ Weaver Ice t and land ice is 2 different thing. The sea ice cover the surrounding water of Antartica is growing, but the ice on continental Antartica(which is what matters) is melting  	5	6

2016-08-30 23:52:21	DJ Jack Frybulous	Unfortunately, this film gives people the impression that all we'll have to do is move someplace higher, as if the only problem is rising sea-level. It says nothing about temperature, and most of us with heads not buried in sand are already experiencing that. The biggest problem, brothers and sisters, is a virulent form of capitalism that has as its sole motivating force the seeking of profit, which turns everything on the planet - all life-forms, all geologic and geogic features like mountains and rivers, trees and oceans - as units from which to derive profit. We won't have a prayer of survival until we stop treating corporations as persons, giving them the same rights as flesh-and- blood people, without expecting of them any of the moral and ethical obligations (to each other) that real people have.   	31	2

2016-08-30 20:17:11	Jesse Bittermann	Sorry if I am wrong, but ice is bouyant. So if you had a glass with water and ice, the ice will melt, but there will be no rise or drop in water levels. This is because is something is placed into water, it will displace its weight in water. So if we used that in this situation, all of Earths ice will melt, but the water levels wont rise. So, no flooding. If your an expert in this stuff please let me know, because it is quite facinating.  	5	6

2016-08-30 03:03:55	nuclearcasserole	the one essential component that is going to throw off the whole "expected scenario", the area of the Eastern Lands of Siberia, are the most volcanically active on the planet, once the first long frozen volcanic pipeline emerges into an atmosphere of billions of billions of tons of flammable methane hydrates. As the surrounding volcanic containment ice melts, the volcanoes will get much bigger, and will spread quite quickly, as the methane burns, even underwater, the Arctic Ocean will be displaced by a huge and incredibly increasing lava flow, and the fires will spread to more areas, places as far away as Georgia, on the East Coast of the USA, could see the Ocean rise about 12 feet in a week. It would boggle the mind with the widespread tsunami's and the widespread arrivals of walls of water, everywhere on the planet...  	31	6

2016-08-28 10:40:39	Sirat Ahmad	you douche bag video maker...... fuck you...... according to science ice has less density then water means has more volume at the same mass........ if all ice is melted the total ice will become more dense as it becomes water.... thus occupies less volume and the level of oceans will fall down rather than rising........ stupid....  	33	6
2016-09-27 13:13:22	Nassier Yusoff	u r the douche bag lmao...what u said only implied if the ice is under sea level ,and lots of goddamn poles ice actually above sea level,so the sea level will be rising  	5	6

2016-09-03 22:11:13	Cody Williams	@***** You will have to chat with Nasa on why the ice mass around the south- pole is at an all time high (recent history). I can not give you the reasons why in the way you can acccept. I am sure NASA will have better more clear answers on why that is.  	5	6

2016-09-03 00:40:53	Cody Williams	@*****​ enough dude. Forward all your future assertions and objections to NASA directly., Not me.  	35	2
2016-09-02 17:20:39	Cody Williams	@***** give up dude... What I said is still true. Humans may work on yearly judgement timeframe but nature doesn't. In the big picture, the ice mass has never been this high in generations upon generations upon generations. Keep trying. What's next for you?  	20	2
2016-09-02 16:01:13	Cody Williams	@***** So, you agree that ICE mass is at all time high on Antarctica? Cool. End of story. Thanks for agreeing with me (and NASA).  	5	6
2016-09-02 15:39:31	Cody Williams	@***** No, that was a quote from NASA... I did not claim it was from this year. My original position is ICE is at an all time high in the Antarctica.... For fuck sacks... if you have a problem with this TALK TO NASA if you don't agree with them..... why bother trying to tell me?  	20	2
2016-09-02 15:32:00	Cody Williams	@***** You are wrong again... i said the ice levels are at an all time high. You brought up the dates. 1) You are saying I am wrong. 2) Nasa says I am right. 3) You are saying nasa is wrong. You must be a dumb ass tian it seems.  	20	2
2016-09-02 15:18:43	Cody Williams	@***** ??? WTF man... Lets recap since you obviously must be on drugs or something... 1) I said that the ice mass is growing in Antarctica. 2) You say I am wrong. 3) NASA says I am right. If you are saying I am wrong because I am saying NASA says the ICE mass is growing, that means you are saying NASA is also wrong. Like I suggested, you should call them and tell them tre wrong and publish your data that you claim is correct. Also, where did mythology angle come into play? That was wayyy left field man.  	20	2
2016-09-02 14:55:59	Cody Williams	@***** Dude, what is your problem with NASA... you linked what i claimed and YOU STILL SAY ITS WRONG? here is something even from the end of 2015...  t-greater-than-losses In the end, you are just being stupid and wrong. I can not stress to you enough... if you DISAGREE with NASA, then your issue is with them. Call them and tell them tre wrong, maybe they will change their site to suit your views. I doubt they will do that though. troll on somewhere else... and nice to know you have multiple accounts.. dead giveaway for troll activity.  	35	2
2016-09-02 14:45:00	Cody Williams	@***** Breaking my no reply rule for a sec.... Dude, you are such an , screenshots? for what? I am laughing so hard... glad you found the info you are looking for. Now take your opinion and try to get nasa to change there mind. They will laugh too. Blocking you after this, have no time for replying to kids.  	38	2
2016-09-02 14:24:07	Cody Williams	@***** I have already told you, thier own page from their website. Quote: Sea ice surrounding Antarctica reached a new record high extent this year, covering more of the southern oceans than it has since scientists began a long-term satellite record to map sea ice extent in the late 1970s I do not have the link for the page, but it was in one of the first results in searching their site. IF YOU DISAGREE with them, take it up with them! Worst case scenario is maybe they will give you a job since you seem to know more then they do. :) Have an awesome and incredible day. No further replies coming.  	31	6
2016-09-02 13:06:14	Cody Williams	@***** You would have to ask Nasa for the evidence for their claim of Antarctica ice is higher then it has ever been, I do not have their data. LIKE I SAID, this is something you would have to chat to them about. And if you disagree with them, something to debate with them. I can not give you any more info then that, sorry.  	5	6
2016-09-02 04:32:34	Cody Williams	@*****​ I am also agreeing with NASA. I think you may have to talk your position over with NASA themselves since THEIR SITE also says the icemass is growing and will countinue to grow. Why not give them a call to fix their data? I have no power over it, chat them up.  	35	2
2016-09-02 02:54:45	Cody Williams	@***** Disagree with nasa all you wish, but know that you are most likely wrong. Sorry man. If you feel like chatting, I am not your guy. The good news: don't worry about rising water levels, I 100% guarantee it will NOT effect you nor anyone in your linage for generations and generations and generations.  	31	2
2016-09-02 00:12:37	Cody Williams	@***** one could again flip that same claim back at you. Believe what you want, your beliefs hurt . Straight from Nasa: Sea ice surrounding Antarctica reached a new record high extent this year, covering more of the southern oceans than it has since scientists began a long-term satellite record to map sea ice extent in the late 1970s. (is that main stream enough for you? lol)  	20	2
2016-09-01 23:12:33	Cody Williams	@*****​ one could reverse exactly what you just said back on to you.  	19	5
2016-09-01 22:02:11	Cody Williams	@***** Google it, from all major credible sources, the mass is increasing. I did not say it is immune. It is virtually immune until a world event, not human event. You give humans too much credit.  	37	2
2016-08-29 21:33:40	Cody Williams	@***** the point is this. The south pole consists of 90% of the world ice mass. The other 10% simply is just ice cubes. The way things are at the moment, and the very distant future, makes the south pole virtually immune to melting. In fact, the south pole Ice mass is increasing. Can they melt someday? Yes. Because of humans? Nope.  	5	6

2016-08-28 14:07:15	Cody Williams	@ No. But it does show there is some over hyped fear about this concept. Would the oceans rise? Yes. How much? Very little (relatively). Would it change the world? Nope. Would some cities have to adjust/move? Yup. Is it something to worry about? Nope.  	14	3

2016-08-27 21:48:11	Bill Fox	Global ing is a crock, which is why it has been rebranded as climate change. The earth has a climate, it changes. Whether humans have any real effect on it is still not a given, in fact the opposite seems likely. Do you really want to support punitive government "green taxes" (now there's an oxymoron for you morons) which make no actual difference? Considering how much of the planet is unpopulated it is only coastal areas which are affected int he main. The reason a lot of islands in the far east are apparently sinking is because of sand dredging off-shore. The sand is taken and sold, the beaches sink to compensate, the island gets smaller, and this is used to "prove" rising sea levels. According to Al Gore's crew, both polar ice caps would have melted by 2020. According to NASA, both are much bigger. Why do some of you so desperately want to blame humans for something which is not actually happening?   If you don't like my opinion, check out Piers Corbyn, the brother of the Labour leader. He explains it in terms eve global ing fanatics should be able to understand.   This video of what could happen, is more left-wing scaremongering.  will out eventually.  	31	2

With all of the false and deceptive "Facts" coming out of the "Consensus" of many Scientists, skepticism seems in order.      Please Remember that in the early 1900's, a consensus of Scientists also thought Euthanasia was settled and was instituted with the help of Margaret Sanger. She started Planned Parenthood.      The Government of this country and many others wants to control their populations.   "Climate Change" is ,in my opinion, a hoax on humanity and most of the world fell for it.      Can we control Tornadoes? How about Hurricanes? Rain perhaps? This is only weather, not a Planetary scale temperature control initiative. We can't control anything on this planet and thinking we can is a high form of arrogance and selfishness.  	31	6

2016-08-24 08:15:08	Mike Cronis	This is an uneducated view. The model does not take into account the following scientific facts:   1\. The model does not show fresh-water accumulation inland (such as rivers and streams) or under-water rivers   2\. The model does not show the increase in humidity in the vast volumes of air (which would take up most of the melted ice as vapor).   3\. One pole is always facing away from the Sun in that pole's "winter". In the summer in the northern hemisphere, it's -73 deg. F in Antarctica, so both poles cannot "melt" all their ice accumulation.   4\. The model does not show the current estimated amount of volume of current ice on the Earth and only shows it melting solely into the ocean (this is highly an exaggerated amount).   5\. Even if all ice melted on Earth (both poles simultaneously, somehow) and only went into the oceans (somehow) the volume of water vs. the steepness of shores would amount to a height increase of 3 inches to 3 feet (depending on location).   6\. This model is not scientific at-all.  	31	6

2016-08-21 22:32:20	Illuminati10101	I don't know what to make of all these doom sayers.   I live on the East coast of  ( Scotia) where the highest tides in the world are observed, 65 feet between high and low tides.   I have lived all my life about 60 meters from the edge of the Atlantic ocean. I'm just over 50. I built my house just up the road from my fathers who is still with us today and where he lived all his life,where I grew up.   We talked about this once and both agreed that the water is no higher now than it was in the 1960's,.....with all the ice that they say has already melted and the state size pieces of Antarctica they keep saying are breaking off we should be noticing a difference no matter how small,.but there's nothing.   There are also markers in and around the waters here to measure the tides and they show no change as well.   I watch these videos by environmentalist where they show show huge blocks of ice crashing into the water up in ,......THAT"S WHAT"S SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN! it's a Glacier tre always moving and it ends in the ocean,...that's normal!   Then I see them put up pictures of Mt. Fuji and show everyone a before winter picture of the mountain with a full snow cap then they show one a summer picture where it's is 80% gone and get everyone in N.A. freaked out that the snow caps are melting! Those are SUMMER pictures of the Mountain. Get them to put up a current winter picture!   I'm not saying it isn't happening or won't happen I just think environmentalists are using scare tactics to further their cause.  	31	2

2016-12-14 04:28:41	M Onion	Because of how much the north polar ice weighs, sea levels in places such as , , and scandinavia are actually projected to lower as it melts. The lost weight, once pushing the crust into the mantle, allows it to rise. So while your observations--unless taken in a rous, scientific manner--are inadmissible as anecdotal evidence, such an observation does in theory fit current models of sea level change in the face of melting polar caps.  	5	6

2016-09-03 20:00:41	Species 8472	98% of Obama's scientists agree. A 2015 poll of n Meteorological Society members also reported a diversity of opinion. Of the 1,862 members who responded (a quarter of the organization), 59 percent stated that human activity was the primary cause of global ing, and 11 percent attributed the phenomenon to human activity and natural causes in about equal measure, while just under a quarter (23 percent) said enough is not yet known to make any determination.  	20	2
2016-09-03 04:53:08	Aysah Spades	@MK Albert 98% general consensus now agree so your point is moot.  	38	5
2016-09-03 03:05:40	Species 8472	Even those who went to school and are scientist cannot makeup there minds. In the 70's the Climatologists were screaming about the coming ice age, even Time magazine had done an edition on it. “If present trends continue, the world will be about four degrees colder for the global mean temperature in 1990, but 11 degrees colder by the year 2000,” claimed ecology professor Kenneth E.F. Watt at the University of California in 1970. “This is about twice what it would take to put us in an ice age.” Of course, 2000 came and went, and the world did not get 11 degrees colder. No ice age arrived, either. In 1990 Princeton professor and lead UN IPCC author  Oppenheimer, made some dramatic predictions while working as “chief scientist” for the Environmental Defense Fund. By 1995, he said then, the “greenhouse effect” would be “desolating the heartlands of  and Eurasia with horrific drought, causing crop failures and food riots.” By 1996, he added, the Platte River of Nebraska “would be dry, while a continent-wide black blizzard of prairie topsoil will stop traffic on interstates, strip paint from houses and shut down computers.” The situation would get so bad that “ police will round up illegal n migrants surging into Mexico seeking work as field hands.” And as far as our illustrious leader who's swallowed the BS hook line and stinker, ironically, perhaps, is that there had been no global ing since long before he took office. Worldwide, the disastrous forecasts by climate alarmists have proven to be similarly embarrassing. By now, anybody who follows “climate” news knows that “global ing” has been on what alarmists call “pause” for 18 years and counting, despite ongoing increases in CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere. The stubborn refusal of temperatures to rise (and accelerate) as forecasted by all of the UN’s 73 “climate models” has discredited the models, the UN, and the alleged “science” behind the computer forecasts. Every single model predicted more ing than has occurred, an atrocious record that defies explanation. Even a monkey rolling the dice or a scam artist pretending to read the future from a crystal ball would have a better record, based only on the laws of probability. Of course, alarmists have come up with at least a dozen excuses for the failure of temperatures to rise in accordance with their debunked models. The Obama administration’s favorite: the theory of “The Ocean Ate My Global Warming.” Last year, the Associated Press, citing leaked documents, reported that the U.S. government had pressured the UN IPCC to incorporate that excuse, for which there is not a  of observable evidence, into its most recent global-ing report.  	31	2

2016-08-21 17:01:15	martinishot	All the ice below sea level, which is the vast majority of the ice, is currently displacing more volume now than if it melted. Are these claims of rising sea levels taking that into account?  	5	6
2017-07-21 16:12:33	Colby Williams	ONLY....ice that is on land that melts raises sea levels....mainly Antarctica and .....account for more 90 percent....  	5	6
2016-12-11 23:16:59	JαmëŽǎɏe	Okay, since everyone in this chat thread is obviously an  from the Northern Hemisphere you're thinking of the Arctic which is almost never considered when talking about sea-level rise. Whenever tre talking about "ice-caps causing sea rise" we're talking about  and Antarctica. Both that are actually large amounts of ice stacked on top of mountains and islands hidden under the ice. Large shelves of ice on both landmasses due to melting etc, literally slide right off the land and into the ocean (causes the sea- level rise). Ice melts, creates pockets of water that melts more ice, large pool builds between ice and land.... ice slides off. Easiest demonstration of this is instead of ice sitting in a glass of water, have a half-full glass and then ice stacked on top of each other. Ice at the bottom will not affect water, but the ice stacked on top does.  	31	6
2016-11-28 16:56:29	Jerry C	Rising sea level is only affected by ice on land. Ice that is already in the water has zero effect on sea levels  	5	6
2016-11-09 19:42:29	Corporal_Cake	@ "The volume of below sea level" good job. Talking about reading skills whilst you can't write. Anyway his point is not that there isn't underwater ice, but that the large majority of ice underwater is in s which as we established don't change anything. I doubt there is enough gravity to solidify water to ice and it isn't cold enough either to send a constant stream of melting ice upwards. What none of you ever considered though is that Illuminati actually fake ice floating and really it's a conspiracy. That's so they can remain hidden in their underwater HQ covered in natural ice.  	5	6
2016-11-09 03:46:21	martinishot	I wrote the ice below sea level is the vast majority not all. idk if you've ever taken a reading comprehension course.The volume of below sea level water in solid frozen state compared to its volume in liquid state is the issue,not how much of that is made up of s.  	33	6
2016-11-09 02:49:35	Riley Schroeder	All the ice is under sea level? Idk if you've ever taken an intro physics course or umm, I don't know, LOOKED A FUCKING GLASS OF ICE WATER, ice floats kiddo. There is a negligible amount of ice under sea level that is not in ice bergs, which would net no change in sea level if tll melted. Only ice melting on land contributes to the rise of sea levels.  	5	6
2016-10-23 21:01:15	Corporal_Cake	@***** Yeah that was me.  	25	7
2016-10-23 16:00:15	Corporal_Cake	@***** Oh did I forget to go collect my farts back up?  	27	5
2016-10-23 13:29:48	Corporal_Cake	@ I say for the ice that doesn't float because this comment specifically says about underwater ice. Also there could be enough pressure at the bottom of the ocean for water to be forced into a solid. I don't know these thing I'm just presuming based on the original comment. Plus there could be ice trapped underneath something.  	5	6
2016-10-23 06:26:35	joskemom	 Of course 'ice underwater' floats. When was the last time you saw ice sink to the bottom of anything? The water displaced by the ice berg, ice t, ice anything will have the volume filled by the water resulted from the 'melt down'. No change in sea level, or if anything, a slight drop since ice is not totally solid ice. The GW hoax has melting ice causing rising sea levels as one of its many basic flaws.  	5	6
2016-10-20 17:22:46	Corporal_Cake	Icebergs melting would do literally nothing to the sea level, as they have the same weight as the volume they take up. That means that after melting, the ice shrinks down and fills in the same amount of  as the water would in the underwater part of the . The only thing that would affect water levels is ice above water, and ice underwater which for whatever reason doesn't float. The issue with 's post is that the ice underwater is either part of an  or too deep underwater to melt. If the temperature of the ocean got hot enough to melt enough ice to drop the sea level again then we would have a much more severe issue on our hands.  	5	6
2016-09-09 22:20:10	Nishant	density of ice is 0.9167 g/cm3 at 0 °C, whereas water has a density of 0.9998 g/cm³. melting of ice below sea level does not change the sea level significantly as it is not adding extra water into sea. Also its a cyclic phenomena it melts in one season and freezes in another. But melting of  and Antarctic ice caps will add additional ICE (water) into sea - additional volume -- sea level rise significantly  	5	6

2016-08-30 01:11:38	Pixy Wings	The problem is not the s floating on the oceans melting, its all the ice/snow up north that's sitting on the ground and then all that melts and makes its way into the ocean.

Also.. more severe storms due high average temperatures.   But even with all this, that is the minor of humanity troubles if we dont solve (it does not have solution) the IA issue that is coming faster than everybody things.  	31	2

I have read predictions of how high the oceans would rise in a scenario where all the ice melted or slid into the oceans and it was 67 meters total... about 220 feet. But, since the average temperature in Antarctica is about -37°F we don't have to worry about the ice melting... sliding into the ocean... that depends on thermal activity below the ice... don't see much happening there that would cause all of the ice to slide...  	31	6

2016-09-13 15:11:01	Paramone Gaming	@MrFancyPants Its just a joke from my side, I actually think the Confederate States of  are a pretty good idea, and one that has been heavily antagonized due to slavery, despite slavery remaining in the  for some time after winning the civil war... Also the confederacy didnt expect slavery to be eternal, they just wanted to keep it until the railways in the center states were done with. Sure slavery is wrong, but analyzing both sides with equal respect you get where confederates came from, and it had none to do with racism (not to say they werent racist, just that their ideals werent dependant on that) Being part of the only standing confederation on earth and seeing our country be easily the best or among the best in the world proportionally, we hope more countries would be like us  	30	0

2016-09-08 14:05:34	Epa01	I find this really funny, Sweden doesn't even HAVE an army. Roughly 50-75 000 men. Ok, Sweden HAS a good air force and navy (about 250 jets and 250 ships), but it's still not enough to win a war. Finland has 350 000 active soldiers and 900 000 reservists in total, so BEAT THAT! (also don't forget the artillery and all the anti air guns!). Also it's not a good idea to call other countries gay, especially if you are from Sweden. Man... if you only knew how many gay jokes there are about Sweden. I'm not from Sweden, but I don't hate the country. Sweden is OK for me, so don't get offended by this because I didn't mean to insult anyone.  	21	0

Most of the continental land masses are above the level that would be flooded, but most of the major population centers are not. It's not about how many square miles of land we lose, it's how many square miles of civilization.  	5	3
2016-08-19 11:33:56	No Name	@ considering how much I conducted research on the amount of ice we have and to receive only such scale of "devastation" is pretty minimal. I perfectly know how Scotland looks like since i was there many times, and trust me, once again, the amount of thick ice there is and for it to all melt, it will indeed flood about quarter of Scotland despite the its high elevations above the sea level + Iceland and Norway that they don't even focus on, should be impacted too!  	31	6
2016-08-17 18:33:55	cogwheel42	The "catastrophe" is that some of the largest population centers on the planet will have to move, abandoning some of humanities greatest investments in civil infrastructure.

The hotter things get, the more ice melts. The more ice melts, the higher the sea level gets. So far, 8"/200mm higher, and 1/7th" each year. 8,000 years ago it was 4degC colder. Ice ts like 's covered North  all the way down to New York City. There was so much ice, the Bering Strait and the North Sea were dry land. Then it ed. Most of the ice melted. The seas rose.

Also, sea levels rise logarithmically, as the volume of the oceans rise linearly, the amount they rise in elevation increases logarithmically.  	5	6
2019-08-18 02:13:56	Rob Fielding	@ not so much that it all melts simultaneously, but that it's not a paradox if at some point there is a sudden rise in sea levels. i think people seeing CO2 spike, will deny that there are any effects until it is irreversible and obvious.  	5	6
2019-08-18 01:55:02	John Peric	@ oh my apologies I read one line wrong. Anyways, yes you're statement on ice melt is right, it melts abruptly. However, you're making it seem as if the surface of the ice caps will melt simultaneously. No, as the temperatures VR see first it will be the coastal ice, then the sub-coastal area of the ice t, and eventually the interior. For the Antarctic it would take even longer. Also...    	5	6
2019-08-18 00:22:10	Rob Fielding	@ short answer: accumulated on land from snow, and NOT MELTED. sea levels rise when water is taken out of the ocean. they fall when it accumulates on land as permanent snow.  	5	6
2019-08-18 00:11:53	Rob Fielding	Industrial civilization has only been going on for 100 years; a rounding error for the end of 8000 years. CO2 levels are rising very sharply since the industrial age started, which is a straightforward measured number. Sea levels drop when water is taken out of the sea. Water is taken out of the see when it falls on land without ever melting ... to run off back into the sea. Sea levels falling for 8000 years makes plenty of sense. It does not contradict the idea that 100 years ago CO2 levels started to spike, at the beginning of the industrial revolution. The question is only if doing things like burning less oil/wood/coal will do anything about the problem. anies facing being regulated don't like it, and can only honestly argue that measures to regulate them will actually help solve the problem. So naturally, they hire people to not understand the problem. If a completely new energy source, like super- cheap nuclear energy, becomes highly profitable... then these same companies will hire people to actually understand this problem. People figure out how to profit today, so they can live to profit for tomorrow; and companies facing the threat of regulation behave in the same way. I have family in the ippines that have very spotty access to internet/electricity. They can't reduce their consumption, because they want internet access and electricity so they can learn skills to make money just like we do. In the US, we don't want to reduce our consumption either, because we love our standard of living. The FUD about Global Warming is ridiculous. I think some of the proposed solutions to it are also ridiculous; but that doesn't mean it isn't happening. It just might mean that people are going to have to deal with some places they live going underwater, and it wasn't really avoidable due to human nature. CO2 levels may just be a thing that's proportional to the human population with little we can do about it; similar to oxygen levels being proportional to plant population.  	31	2
2019-08-17 23:55:10	John Peric	@ so why have sea levels been falling for 8000 years?  	31	3
2019-08-17 23:32:58	Rob Fielding	a thought experiment.... ice doesn't melt linearly with temperature. say that an area is at -2 celsius, and temperatures rose 1 degree per 10 years. everything looks fine for 20 years, then there is a phase change where the ice turns into water and that all runs off into the ocean. that would be the situation with a non-accelerating temperature rise. but if temperature rise accelerates, assume that it's the shape of a parabola with really small constants. it sneaks up on you, until in a few short years a coastal city turns into something like venice, then flooding is so common that you can't insure against flooding, and in a few short years... it's not just flooding, but the area is permanently underwater. because even if temperatures go back down, if it doesn't accumulate on land as snow that doesn't melt, the water levels won't go back down. there's no scientific disagreement at all in what happens if the ice melts. there isn't disagreement on if the ice will melt in response to CO2 rise. there isn't even disagreement that it IS rising. the controversy is only whether the human-originated _discretionary_ CO2 contributions amount to the dominant contribution to rising CO2 levels, which would be our mechanism for doing anything about it. some people get paid to "not understand" the problem (ie: "shills" hired out of the science community, or manufactured from popular pseudo-science communities). currently, it seems that you can only profit off of continuing to do what we are doing. if people suddenly find a way to profit off of correcting the problem (CO2 rise), then suddenly people will be getting paid to "understand the problem". The people hired to actually understand the problem may or may not discover/execute any solutions to the problem. (ie: new energy technology, frugality, lower birth rates, etc .... don't rule out a new energy technology being so compelling, that it's way more profitable to fix the problem than ignore it!). a perfect example of this will be when we try to buy , the question of WHY? will come up. the justification will be that... there is incredible natural wealth underneath the ice in , and the ice is going to melt, so we need to buy . you can use markets to tell who believes the things they say.  makes money bets against what tctually believe.  	31	2
2019-08-17 23:12:54	Rob Fielding	@ Trucking Gray If the US President is now asking to buy , then that tells you something. Even if he says that global ing is "a hoax", he wants to spend billions of dollars on taking advantage of much of  melting to reveal its natural resources. Anybody that says that something is a hoax, but bets billions of dollars on it; is proving that they know it's not a hoax. I would say however that there may be nothing that can be done about it. It's a game of chicken where  wants to "go first" to reduce their standard of living; all in taking measures that won't be sufficient in the end. (That's the ONLY thing about the global ing "controversy" that is real... whether it really is feasible to do something about it. You are dealing with billions of people trying to survive day-to- day, who don't care about tomorrow until they make it through today.). Generally, "accelerating" means quadratic change (ie: falling object: -t - (1/2) * (t^2) * g). That means that for a long time, you will see unimpressive levels of melting, until in a few short years, it turns disastrous. Some people will act totally surprised. Everybody will have to adapt in the end. It may throw the food chain into chaos. The earth will certainly adapt. It's not clear how much destruction civilization will experience as it adapts as well.  	31	2

2017-03-28 11:31:10	Dave -in-NJ	All : the question is NOT if humans, at the current population levels are polluting our planet at an unprecedented scale. back in the 1970/1980's Scientific n ran an article about loosing 1 million sq miles of rain forest a year... and how that would take out a biological 'filter' and effect planetary COOLING, back when the rage was 'nuclear winter' and how the planet was heading into an ICE AGE. fast forward to 2000 and all the global alarmists switched to global ing. but, REAL science is simple. it takes 174 calories to turn water from a solid to a liquid. not a temperature change, just a PHASE CHANGE. got that ? 174 calories. but, if you take the EXACT SAME amount of energy that EXISTED to MELT the ice, it would turn that same water to 174 degrees ! so WHATEVER energy source existed 20,000 years ago that, THAT source melted the ice. and without humans. and THAT source, but simple (and incorrect) science would turn that SAME amount of water to 174 degree water !! 174 is the NATURAL water temperature from THAT energy source. imagine that 2 miles of ice melted, and you were looking at the last ice cube on the ground and blamed your car. what you are missing is WHAT CAUSED that SUPER MASSIVE energy to melt that much ice ? to clarify my note about incorrect science, you have to account for temperature loss into , and thermal dynamics. the math and science are correct, the APPLICATION is not. so, the current alarmist trend is using junk science and EVERY computer model was proven to be completely wrong in the 15 years. 97% of scientists agree that climate chance should be STUDIED. 0.03% believe that it is MAN caused. however, the USA just went through a purge to get as many of the true researchers OUT of the field, so now, in the USA 97% of the scientists who answered YES to 'is MAN responsible' in order to get a job and a grant, of those 97%, over 10% still believe it, but if you watch, there is a huge mass of scientists who are saying they cannot hold to the political ideology and HAVE to follow the FACTS, and are being forced out. One day the evidence will prove this to the masses, and all the alarmists will follow along and most will pretend that it was their position all along, or will just stop talking about climate and press the pollution alarm.  	31	2
2017-03-28 04:40:35	Bruce Burns	 Have you noticed in the news the massive natural methane pools in Siberia which end up exploding?  	20	2
2017-03-28 03:32:52	Jason Dutchman	Carbon dioxide is a gas ESSENTIAL to life on the earth and has been for billions of years. The earth has been much hotter for much longer...long before humans came along. Back in the 70s, it was "settled science", all the scientists agreed that we were going to be in a cataclysmic ice age, then...nothing. Then, global ing was the "settled science" and all the ice at the poles would be melted by 2013, then...NOPE. Aren't you getting a bit tired of chicken little?!? Granted, it's a good thing to come up with ways to reduce pollution and keep "bad air" from being sent up into the atmosphere, but there are forces at work far more powerful and effective than us puny humans! Milankovitch cycles along with other factors FAR outweigh what we have done. Greenhouse gases leak out of the ground and under the oceans by the hundreds to thousands of tons...daily. We may be screwed, but the earth has seen much, much worse...many dozens of times.  	20	2
2017-03-27 23:49:04	Dave -in-NJ	all : seems you have no clue. imagine yourself buried under 2 miles of ice. then, after 20,000 years the ice melts. and someone drives by in a car. do you shout at them for pollution the atmosphere and melting 2 miles of ice over 20,000 years ? you can say you want clean air, and I am right there with you. but, unless you can say that Republicans are GOD's and have control over time, and the laws of physics and the rest of humanity are mere mortals who cannot control anything. then, I may not be the dumb ass in this conversation.  	37	2

2017-03-25 01:00:38	Dave -in-NJ	Var: seems you are looking into the  mirror. you have zero comprehension of energy. imagine the SuperBowl Arena you can pick any one. was a massive snow cone.. at time..... and you and I walk in, and there at the 50 yard line is an ice cube. you look at me and blame me because I smoked a cigarette..... 30 million tons of ice... but, because I had a smoke once... it is my fault. the IPCC clearly says that in about 50 years... there MIGHT be a fraction of a degree that could be pinned to human causes. but you think that because 15 years ago there was a really hot year, and then last year, it go hot again... and this happened 500 years ago, but lasted over 200 years... well, that does not fit, so ignore that.... how can you accept such lies ? and then you have the aptitude to point at my intelligence ?  	20	2
2017-03-24 22:22:42	VarietyVG	Yeah anyone who took science class in 2nd grade can say that, what you don't understand is that the process of natural global ing is being sped up by humans! Jeez are you a professor of idiocy?  	37	2

2017-03-22 01:21:16	Dave -in-NJ	Anyone who thinks MAN is the cause of global ing is incompetent and uneducated. The planet just came out of an ice age. that is 2 miles of ice over new york city. planetary sea levels 300 feet lower. if you cannot understand PHASE CHANGE and how much energy it takes to turn ice to water, you have no grasp on climate change. it takes 174 calories to turn ice to water. it takes 174 calories to turn 32 deg water to 174 deg water. so, whatever source there was that melted the ice IS EXPECTED to make the water go to 174 degrees, or a NATURAL STATE. if anything, MAN is SLOWING IT DOWN. ANY effort to do ANYTHING should be uses to create shelters that use no energy and can survive 200 degree heat and -200 degree cold. that is the only legitimate option. and if you want to destroy big oil, build a passive house.  	31	2
2017-03-21 22:06:30	VarietyVG	+Ormr Skerhundr yeah its called global ing. Climate change is affecting us but people like you are too incompetent to understand that climate change can't make such a drastic change. it takes time  	20	2

2017-03-20 01:19:18	Dave -in-NJ	Max : so, if everything that goes around, comes around, then the Earth is the beginning, middle and end. and based on infinity = infinity, the earth is not only the center, but also the furthest point from it.  	35	2
2017-03-20 00:59:13	Maxwell Baker-Terhaar	Lonk based on the theory of relativity the universe goes out in every direction forever and bc infinity equals infinity technically the earth is the center of the universe  	35	2
2017-03-20 00:56:58	Dave -in-NJ	te_cruz : sorry homophobe, but the lies about 96% of scientists saying HUMANS are the root case is about as insane as saying the earth is the center of the universe or that it is flat. every historical ice age would then have to be man caused. only about 0.3% of climate scientists say it is human caused. you need to read the survey questions. 93% say that man *MAY* have some effect and that the science NEEDS TO BE STUDIED, and THAT is the consensus, that the problem needs to be studied. IF you were literate, and read the IPCC report the SCIENTISTS say that there is no evidence that MAN is the CAUSE. if you read the 'summary' written by politicians, it says that a global tax needs to be implemented and paid to the UN. oh, and it has some findings that are not based on the results of any actual research. Here is a question. at what age were you when you decided that politicians never lie to you and politicians are looking out for your best interest ? if you want a belly laugh, watch Bill Nye, he supports the idea that for 500 years, there was a 'regional' heat wave in Europe that had temperatures about 20 degrees above normal. It had to be the only time in the existence of our planet that such a 'regional' occurrence happened. Sorry for exposing some facts, I know those whose religious beliefs have to make MAN the cause of all ills have a hard time with actual facts. make your self happy, insult people, or quote media reports or politicians. they usually have a calming effect on people who are followers and can't reason things for themselves.  	20	2

2017-02-26 02:37:38	Ray Conlogue	No you're not, +. Learn some facts. Google YouTubeClimateChange and tune in to the many thousands of hardworking scientists who are trying to tell us that no place is safe from the climate collapse that is already underway. It will increase the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere of the whole planet. There is no island in Guam, or anywhere else, that can escape it. By pretending that you are safe, you exempt yourself from the hard work that we all have to do to protect our planet. I just bought an electric car, even though I can't really afford it, because we must stop burning fossil fuels. Full stop, no bullshit please. Just stop fucking burning it. If you don't, your beloved Guam is going to drop a dinosaur sized piece of shit on your head.  	20	2
2017-02-26 02:17:23	Ray Conlogue	What a breathless, totally ic piece of shit you just wrote,  Gray. You know what it tells me? It tells me you know very well that climate change is real and it is going to kill millions of human beings. Some people react to that by looking for the courage to face the challenge. Others, like you, write breathless, asterisk-infested rants which communicate only one kind of information: that you are scared shitless and you think that shouting and bullshitting is going to make this crisis go away. Please try to be quiet. Lock yourself in a cave and suck your thumb if it makes you feel better. But get the hell off this thread and stop poisoning the minds of vulnerable people with your appalling lies. Some of those people possess the courage that you lack. Try to find a more honorable way to share this world with them than insulting their courage in order to buck up your detestable cowardice.  	20	2

2016-10-19 22:06:41	Aron en Ark	Many Canadian population centres are inland and thus would be unaffected by rising sea levels. A lot more of the Canadian arctic archipelago would be underwater, but the makers of this video didn't bother to render that; most likely because not enough elevation data exists, or because  lives there.  	5	3

2016-10-14 03:44:56	MegaPotato	Flowey The Flower look up the facts Bees are all ready on the extinction watch list, bees will die off at this rate and all plants need pollen. Plants use pollen to reproduce without no bees there would be very little pollen pollen transporting around, less pollens means less flowers survive. This is 4th grade science.  	37	1
2016-10-12 23:08:28	Thiccity D	@ I doubt bees would go extinct entirely, and even if they did, not all plants rely on pollinators. Humans could still get by.  	3	1
2016-10-10 03:58:07	MegaPotato	Flowey The Flower you know we rely on those animals let's say almost all bees day from the heat, there would be less plants because they can't exchange pollen, with out plants animals don't have food so they die, without animals we die  	3	1
2016-10-09 16:09:08	Thiccity D	LexToTheZ You realize you are a human, right? And if such a thing happened, I doubt humans would go extinct, but ridiculous amounts of other species would.  	3	1

2016-08-16 21:54:52	Rikki0	I wonder how all that money the global alarmists are getting from people is going to get the Sun out of its ing cycle? That's what is causing the ice to melt, you know. Not your hair spray.  	20	6

2016-08-14 17:58:29	ilikeceral3	This isn't perfect-some places would flood more than other due to soil composition, and the weight of the water might push some earth down causing more flooding in some places. Not to mention that if all the ice melted, most of the earth would be so hot it would become desert/uninhabitable, at least to humans. I hope someone does another one of these that accounts for that, best I can think of is dubia from the world dream bank and that's still not perfect.  	5	6

2016-09-20 18:46:17	Edward Rhoads	Actually the prediction is that if we hit the 2 C above industrial mark then the ice all melts. This prediction is based on 50 million years of climate data that shows an inflection pt at 2 C that when we are above it there is not ice caps and below it ice caps. The last time we were above was 3 million years ago and there were no ice caps back then.  	31	6
2016-09-20 18:44:51	Edward Rhoads	If we switch to solar in the next 50 years then the ice is safe. If not then it melts in the next 500-2000 years.  	5	6

2016-11-13 12:39:57	UnSubRocky	Correct. The melting ice would just seep into the cracks of the Antarctic continent, and the water would retract around the coastline. I figure we would see a falling sea level worldwide.  	5	6
2016-11-09 00:29:33	uncledeadlythefirst	North pole doesn't count, the amount of water the ice displaces, is greater than the amount of water the ice contains, that's why sea levels haven't changed, even though they say the Arctic ice is gone.  	5	6

The day they STOP changing will be the day the Earth dies!      We have FAR more to fear by a restricted life without the benefits of oil than we EVER should fear life with oil!

2016-08-27 00:33:51	ircpoision Kirby	It isn't really pollution, but moreover how much the land is "above sea level". Which is why Japan isn't overtaken, as it is very mountainous  	5	3
2016-08-24 07:18:12	Rory Dakin	It is no longer possible to have the oxygen content and biodiversity necessary for such a large ocean predator to exist, not entirely because of human interference, but mostly because our planet has become much more stable since that time period when the megalodon was on the top of the food chain.  	5	3

2016-09-21 19:57:58	David Kelly	@ I have read it and my point stands. Create isn't near the Pillars of Hercules and the Minoans weren't wiped out 10k years ago. The only places that fit that don't claim to be located in the Atlantic (something we know to be BS becuase there aren't any signs of submerged land in seafloor mapping) are the Spanish mudflats and northern Morocco. Everything else either isn't located in the right place or was wiped out at the wrong time or not at all. Personally I favor the mudflats as it's a more civilized (in terms of historical scale) region, Morocco is an arid place with few settled peoples prior to the Romans. That's not to say Atlantis will ever be found or even existed, the Minion theory just doesn't work as an historical answer to the question. It CAN (and is) argued that the Atlanteans are totally mythological and the Minions lent their culture to Plato's story but that's a different issue.  	31	3

2016-09-01 13:24:20	David Kelly	@ The problem with the Minoan theory is the whole Pillars of Hercules thing, Crate is in the middle of the Med The minoans were also destroyed less than 10k years ago which is contrary to the story. The mudflats of southern Spain and related ruins fit better as the geogy matches and the area was swamped 10k years ago.  	35	2
2016-09-01 12:30:30	Terry Shulky	+ When Thera (Santorini) blew its top, the resultant tsunami swamped Crete and badly weakened the Minoans. At Knossos, their capital in Crete, the palace was so complicated, it resembled a labyrinth. They worshipped bulls and when the early Greeks sacked Knossos, one can imagine a Greek warrior fighting his way to the 's inner sanctum where he met s Minos himself, wearing a Bull mask. From there to the Minotaur is but a short step. Plato got the sinking story from the Egyptians via Herdotus "The Father of Lies" and embellished it somewhat. He probably would be amused that so many took him seriously, crediting the "Atlanteans" with the ability to fly in flying machines etc. If they read the whole thing they would have noted that the "Atlanteans" were at war with Athens and they weren't winning!  	31	3

2016-09-01 12:47:25	Terry Shulky	+ Until the mid 19th century or so, English farmers brewed "long ale" rather than risk the water. Long ale was rather weak so could be  almost all day without everyone falling over! Just for the record, the "Temperance Movement" prevailed upon the country folk to drink tea instead of ale and it was noticeable that their health declined due to the lack of the trace minerals etc present in the ale!  	11	3
2016-08-30 02:27:04	andiroidYT	@***** No, and I didn't say that. Try reading. I said 'less violent' - which is true. That is why many countries still have the Queen as their Head of State, even though tre independent nations. Even countries whose population are ex-slaves still want to keep the 'evil' British monarchy as their Head of State - for example Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Gre, Jamaica, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. ALL those countries, all based on slavery, still value their connection with Britain. There are no Spanish or ch slave states who have such a connection to their ex-empire, because of the way they were treated. The British were less violent, hence there is less hatred. Look at the british commonwealth, 53 members, all voluntary.  	12	0
2016-08-29 20:33:33	andiroidYT	@harsharsenal1 'Also note, You claimed The British to be one of the 'least' violent empires. Well, they indeed were the worst of all their European cousins. The  killed more people than The USSR and Nazi  did aggregately'. This is a complete fabrication; to put it in perspective the Belgians killed about 10 million people in west africa, in a couple of decades. The British killed less than a million in the whole world, during the whole history of the . Of course, no doubt you are counting things such as famine and disease, which is not 'killing' - killing is deliberate and planned. So, just counting actual deliberate killings, show me a list of 30 million+ dead people the british killed. As I said, the figure is under 1 million from the years 1707-1997 (WW1 & 2 excluded). Far less than the Spanish, Portugese, Belgians and ch. The Nazi Empire killed more people in the first 3 months of 1944 than the Brits managed in almost 300 years. There is NO comparison.  	31	0
2016-08-29 17:05:09	Harsh Godhwani	@ I cannot recollect calling The British 'monsters'. If I did use such a terminology, then I would be very apologetic. It would only be if my prevailing emotions got the better of me. I am not being nationalistic when I state Britain's atrocities. The Mughals were really no better and we have been subjected to external control for centuries. However, what I can defend is that The Indian Subcontinent was indeed an advanced region back then, before the footprints of externalities arrived upon our shores. During The Mughal era, as you rightly pointed out, there numerous other kingdoms and princely states. Locked in conflict amongst themselves. Similar to the dynasties prevalent in China at the time. However, just like China eventually united. The Indian subcontinent had linguistic, cultural, religious and ethnic ties. Making reunification inevitable at some point in the future. Overall if we weigh the pros and cons of British Imperialism, the cons heavily outnumber the pros. Losses during this era were indeed unquantifiable. Coming to your idea of us being thankful for 'democracy'. Thank you, but, we were oppressed for around two centuries, faced economic degradation and faced heavy loss of life, is leaving us 'democratic' at the end a good enough mere 'compensation'? I am aware that nearly all Colonial conquests have been built upon blood and injustice. But what's your point in relation to that? Just because The  or ch committed atrocities elsewhere, does it provide Britain a free pass to commit them upon someone too? Also note, You claimed The British to be one of the 'least' violent empires. Well, they indeed were the worst of all their European cousins. The  killed more people than The USSR and Nazi  did aggregately. But again, this was the past and we are glad to overlook it and move on. However, these points can be raised when many in the west undermine or display ignorance against India. Nevertheless, I thank you for your best wishes towards us. I Really do appreciate it, mate. We vouch for peaceful co-development and do wish our ascendancy can play a role in raising levels of prosperity globally. I wish your country all the best of luck too. Have a great and blessed day, best wishes!  	30	5
2016-08-29 15:46:05	andiroidYT	@harsharsenal1 You have already called the British 'monsters', which I think you know is not true for the majority of the British people at the time, nor even the majority of the british in india. Most were there for business reasons, not to carve out an empire, and a large number were there to 'help' (i.e. christianize, educate) indias poor. Obviously the government was only interested in money and power, as all empires are. I also do not defend any of the atrocities they carried out, most of which occurred due to racism and ignorance. All 'successful' empires exhibit such cruelty, and the british were clearly (along with the dutch) the least violent and repressive of the european empires. The Mughal Empire was not a glorious time for the peoples of India, that is a myth cultivated by nationalists, as all countries do when trying to find reasons for their current situation. Every post-colonial country or minority does this - 'We used to be s! We were the greatest on Earth! Until the White Man came and destroyed our paradise!'. This is not true in almost every case. Another point also has to be made that without the British, the country of India would not exist. There was no 'Ruler of India' before the British joined it all together, it was always hundreds of small states, even the Mughals only ruled a part of modern india. It was Britain who gave India the concept of nationhood, a political and cultural entity; that had never existed in the entire history of the region. The country of India is one of Britains most important achievements, in fact. Who knows what might have happened if the Chinese had taken over, or the Mughals remained and islamic nationalism had started a civil war? The country would certainly not exist in it's present form, nor be a true democracy. Anyway....most brits llike India (certainly more than Pakistan or China) and hope that the country continues to advance. Personally I hope India becomes the major power in asia, and does not do so at the expense of it's people, as China has done. Oh, and I'm not British.  	30	8
2016-08-29 10:20:30	Harsh Godhwani	@ India and Britain are on two completely different stages of Economic development. I am assuming you followed The EU referendum with great interest. Do note how The Brexit camp, namely Gove and son stressed on negotiating and implementing a Free trade agreement with India, China and Japan, post separation from your European cousins. Soon after Brexit, British delegates were here in India to negotiate. Your Business ary has been to India several times this year. Even London Mayor Sadiq Khan called for closer trade relations with India. Certainly you have heard of TATA steal's plant in Port Talbot which employs several thousand British workers. We indeed do have flourishing trade relations. Indian companies employ about 100,000 Britons. Britain wants to be the primary country to profit from India's burgeoning economy. Our potential is astronomical, Britain is aware of that. Our GDP per capita is indeed low, due to the dire straights we were left in during the time of independence. Though progress has been slow and we've often found ourselves reigned upon by corrupt, self centred leaders. Millions have yet been lifted out of poverty and wealth creation has been stupendous to say the least. We indeed do have a long way to go and our current political establishment is the most competent we have ever had. If you consider PWC (Pricewaterhouse Coopers) a prominent and reliable source, which tre acclaimed for being. The results of their study indicated we shall be the world's second largest economy within a mere few decades. Few studies published by other competent figures estimate us to soon become the world's largest economy. You can conduct research upon this for yourself. My point here is, we indeed are in ascendancy. After almost absolute poverty prevalence about 70 years ago, we indeed have come a long way. People in India hold Britain in high regard, we have overlooked the past and look forward to a more prosperous future for our two nations.  	30	2
2016-08-29 10:06:12	Harsh Godhwani	@ I owe you your accomplishment of industrialisation and what you stated is indeed true only till an extent. Industrialisation primarily existed in Britain, but soon spread overseas and others such as The ch, Germans, ns soon capitalised upon it. Britain being a small island, could not accomplish self sufficiency and was reliant on imports of raw materials and natural resources. As Britain had a foothold in India during the time, our raw materials were shipped back to Britain at low costs. Not to mentioned, the surplus of funds, Westminster was racking in from its activities within The Indian Subcontinent. We were not given the righteous scope and autonomy to self develop our own industrial sector.  is, we industrialised in the 20th century, far too late. It may be argued, without colonial interests, how would Britain obtain cheap natural resources and sustain its period of Industrialisation? Similarly, let us hypothetically assume it did. The processes eventually spread overseas and it would only be a matter of time before Asian countries adopted these new practices too. Having considerably more natural resources, stable finances and a larger workforce. Nations such as India and China could indeed have industrialised a while back, had the circumstances been appropriate.  	30	2
2016-08-29 09:57:41	Harsh Godhwani	@ My thinking is neither racist, nor ignorant. Do enlighten me, if a thief breaks into your house and steals a large chunk of your possessions, you would indeed be outraged. Consider I break into your house post him and steal too. Would it make me a 'good samaritan' if I stole less? Wrong is wrong. Irrespective of the perpetrator or the quantifiable loss. Yes, The British did indeed introduce a range of things. But they were simply to make British occupation more convenient. Factors such as, The English Language and railways indeed stay with us till this day. However, we ought to look at the bigger picture here, The very economic system was exploited, from being an urbanised, commercial nation, market controls and capped export prices devastated the economy, all to fuel your rise to ascendancy. Your narrative states, we ought to forgive all the millions killed, all the quantifiable economic losses, all the manpower and resource contributions towards fighting your wars, simply because you left us a number of positive traits? That my friend is an ignorant and narcissistic claim. The Mughals were indeed imperialistic as you claim, but that provides no legal right to you or any other colonial power to replace them and reign misery upon us for nearly two centuries. I recommend a you browse through this,   	30	5
2016-08-29 01:58:23	andiroidYT	Do state on how your ministers are falling over themselves trying to secure a FTA agreement with India after Brexit. Who's boss now?' Let's see last year (latest stats)....UK average income $37,100 - India average income $1,497 UK life expectancy 81.5 years, India 61.2 (not even counting the millions of newborns and infants who die unrecorded each year). India GDP $2073 Billion, UK GDP $2849 Billion (yes, a country of 65 million earns 40% more than a billion indians....). Based on those stats, I think the UK is the boss now, as it has been since the 18th century.  	30	2
2016-08-29 01:46:14	andiroidYT	Our country had the largest share of world GDP' - hmm....this is a common piece of misinformation spread by racist nationalist indians. The reason why indias GDP % relative to the world went down is because THE REST OF THE WORLD (i.e. Britain, US, ) GOT RICHER due to the INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION which happened at the same time. Therefore, RELATIVE to the Western nations, the rest of the world (including india) got relatively poorer (but not ACTUALLY poorer). The fact you don't seem to realise this shows that you just repeat nonsense you read on the internet without thinking about it. So, never repeat this misleading nonsense ever again, because you're been told, right? Good.  	30	2
2016-08-29 01:41:14	andiroidYT	and was the richest area on the planet before the imperialist Brits arrived' - so you were okay with the imperialist Mughals who stole 95% of the wealth of the people and used it to buy jewels and build palaces, but not the Brits who stole far less - but also introduced all of the concepts which today you seem proud of? Your thinking is racist and ignorant.  	9	0

2016-08-27 20:37:12	Harsh Godhwani	+ You are personifying ignorance. I don't blame you though, most media outlets generalise India based upon their narrow minded, xenophobic rhetoric.  Study conducted by Angus Maddison, a renowned British economist at The University Of Cambridge. Do observe how during the age of European colonialism, India and China lose their positions are the world's foremost powers. Now you know how we were left in an abysmal posture in 1947, if you ask me, there is indeed a lot of scope of improvement and work to be done. However, you must comprehend the circumstances due to which these conditions prevail. Overall, we yet haven't done all that bad.  	30	2
2016-08-27 20:08:10	Zoltan Gyongyossy	Subject your country to centuries of imperialism, loot, oppression and genocide. Then, within 69 years of independence become the world's fastest growing major economy and a potential superpower. Has your country achieved that? Actually almost every country would be richer if it wasn't for companies hiring working in your country for shit amount of money only reason you are one of the richest countries is cause your everyones slave bassicly. also in all the pictures of farms it looks like you farm fucking Dirt with starved cows and family members India is a backwater country that really only is succesful for having some gems and precious metals with the underpaid workers  	30	5

2016-08-22 09:26:01	Exodus	Let me summarize my entire opinion on this matter. Yes,the Romans and Greeks bathed regularly, but when the Roman Empire fell, people stopped doing this. In some parts of Europe, people NEVER bathed regularly (West and Northern Europe). During the dark ages,  bathed regularly and in the late 1500's to 1700s, bathing was considered even to be dangerous, as people associated open water with diseases. Then the English went to India and "rediscovered" bathing and brought back 'shampoo', which is verified to be an Indian . It has been accounted that when the Europeans came to Japan for the first time, the Japanese samurai class was disgusted by the scent of the Europeans and their poor personal hygiene. Yes, this was partly due to the fact that they were on ships for long periods of time, but when trrived, they never took the time to take a bath and improve their hygiene. Anyway, the OP is an , saying that the Indians will get a bath for the first time ever, seeing that bathing is an integral part of both Hindu and Islamic rituals. I'm done here.  	30	3
2016-08-22 09:18:51	Exodus	Nope, I saw some truth to your s and added my previous comment to yours, creating a more historically accurate depiction of what life used to be like. Read it again.  	37	5
2016-08-22 08:27:59	LTZ_	@ You just repeated what I said.  	8	5
2016-08-22 07:49:10	Exodus	Exactly. The Greeks and Romans. But all the others did not bath, and especially in the dark ages, when all Roman high culture influence waned, people did not bath at all. Water was associated with disease and people shunned water. No bathing, no drinking of water. People drank wine and ale instead.  	37	3
2016-08-22 07:20:46	LTZ_	@ This is a straight up lie! Bathing was common in Europe since the middle ages in form of public bath houses. Sure there where periods where bathing was not often paracticed by the upper class but they where still washing themselves. Bathing originated in ancient Greece and was perfected by the Romans. Why are you trying to fool us?  	37	3

Our country had the largest share of world GDP before your colonial monsters looted, oppressed, enslaved and committed genocide against our country. Our resources were exploited, your industrialisation was due to sucking the life out of our land, in both world wars our troops fought for your deplorable empire. Most of your supplies and ammunition came from India too. Cowardly British commanders such as Percival sent Indian soldiers to face the brunt of battle. We sacrificed men and material for the force responsible for oppressing us. Churchill killed millions in an induced famine. Your  was created on the basis of imperialism, 'Britannia rules the Waves' now Britannia doesn't even rule The British Isles ;) Scotland and Wales have devolved parliaments. Many in Ireland also want to separate. Do state on how your ministers are falling over themselves trying to secure a FTA agreement with India after Brexit. Who's boss now?  	30	2

2016-06-22 21:13:45	Viktor M	If sea level rose 80 meters in 1 years that would be a huge catastrophy what would possibly bring the civilization on brink of destruction and surely would've killed billions. If it happened in 10 yeras, the civilization might survive but the loss would still be insurmountable. If it did happen in 100 years, it would be once again a huge strain on civilization and would cause quite a loss of life in conflicts following mass migrations and the destruction of still capital in coastal cities and the need to rebuild them further inland. If it happened over 1000 years, we'd barely notice it at all.      Here's the catch: even in the worst scenario, it will take around up to 3 thousand years to simply melt all that ice. So, nothing to worry here, period.  	31	6

2016-08-24 08:35:47	phillip kalaveras	Newly arrived Somali Muslims have transformed small towns and cities throughout the United States into tuulas (Somali villages).The process is underway in such places as Lewiston, Maine; Shelbyville, Tennessee, St. , Minnesota, Clarkston,Georgia, Amarillo Texas and town, North Dakota to name just a few. The n Somalis now display the highest unemployment and poverty rates in the country. Tlso remain the least educated. In Lewiston, Maine, African Muslims, many from the Bantu tribe arrive at the rate of 100 a month. The small town in Maine with a population of 30,000 provided welfare to anyone in need, with the state picking up half the tab. Recipients, including the Muslim refugees, were allowed a generous five years of assistance before their benefits became terminated, and extensions for several additional years on the public dole were not difficult to obtain. Single parents could stay on welfare and go to college. Public housing was also available, although, with the influx of refugees, the housing projects became packed to capacity. Many of the new Somali Muslims who are allowed in as refugees are single mothers with large broods of children. Those who are unable to obtain public housing were handed Section 8 vouchers, which the federal government provided to subsidize their rent in private apartments. Tre bumped to the front of the line, ahead of ns who have been waiting years. The northern city with its frigid climate became welfare heaven for the arrivals from the vast desert areas of northern Africa. The newcomers have shown scant interest in securing employment. When the president of the Lewiston city council, offered to hire 30 Somalis at the rate of $8 to $10 an hour to hold warning signs at construction sites, few displayed interest. The handful, who did apply, said that they were only willing to work between the hours of 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. Somalis are by far the worst, the laziest, the dirtiest, the most violent, turning whole neighborhoods in St  and Minneapolis into slums and no-go areas. Call it racist if you want, but it is the truth. These cities use to be great places to visit or live in. Now they are crime ridden filthy hell holes full of Somalis all expecting handouts from the gov't (taxpayers). When they don't get it, they steal it or rob people on the street or hold up c-stores. Tre human trash and are breeding like rats. The Muslim "breed" is like a cancer that is killing this country from within while our government and most ns do not notice or do not care. It's not just Somali Obama has been quietly bringing in Muslims from all over the world and if everybody were to read the Qur'an you would know what is happening. Muslims plan decades and centuries in advance. The takeover and Islamification of  is going better than expected. They have been using our own n born Bleeding hearts and all the liberal laws we have enacted through the years against us with great effect. I'm afraid most ns don't even know were in a war until it's over and we have lost. Just remember one day when you bleeding hearts have finally destroyed , what was once the greatest dream and hope of a nation in the history of the world, that shining city on a hill that offered so many tired and poor but eager to work and improve their lives a home to come to for refuge, remember that you took our best efforts and selfishly and foolishly turned your blessings against us and your neighbor and ruinously devoured and destroyed everything. Thanks a lot. Thanks for nothing. These Somalis are very well taken care of and want for nothing. Obama has spread them in small towns all across  in order to keep a low profile during the infiltration. Along with everything else they are given a lump sum check depending on the number of dependents and is the reason many are driving brand new  just weeks after arriving. Any of you reading this who has a new car I bet it was a long hard climb to get to that level of being able to buy a new car. Anyway it may be over for the West, i think we may be out numbered we'll know in 3 months, and that is IF Obama don't light off a dirty bomb or start a war with Russia so he can declare Martial Law and suspend the elections...Sweet-dreams kiddies  	31	3

2016-08-15 03:52:30	mike112769	Why do you persist in lumping all liberals into a single group? Just as in any other group, there are many different degrees of liberalism. Not all liberals hold the same values, and neither do all conservatives. Both the republican party and the democratic party are drastically different today than they were even as little as 50 years ago. While it is true that Lincoln freed the slaves as a republican, in our modern era, the republican party has been the party that embodies political racism. During this same time-frame, it has been the democratic party pushing for racial equality. "Not mentioned in the list is that in 1876, Democrats took control of the House of Representatives and no Civil Rights legislation made it to the floor until 1957." As you should know, if the democrats had control for that long, it could only have happened with voter support. You cannot blame all of our country's problems on one political party. I'm white, and I have absolutely no white guilt over anything. Hell. my ancestors were probably too poor to afford a slave, much less a cotton plantation. Why aren't people raising hell over the fact that African tribes would sell their prisoners to the slavers. Slaves weren't kidnapped; they were bought. How about the fact that slightly under 10% of slaves brought to the New World went to the United States. Well over 90 percent of slaves from Africa were imported into the Caribbean and  . Why aren't civil rights groups in the West raising hell about the slaves kept TODAY in the muslime world? An even better question is this: Why do people of differing skin colors turn on each other, and refuse to unite against the governmental encroachment upon our civil liberties and freedoms? We should be uniting against our common enemies, which are career politicians, crooked law enforcement, and the filthy rich. As long as we continue to argue over "race", we will continue to get screwed. Peace.  	31	2

What does the color have to do with it? Self Hate is the Hallmark of Liberalism. It's known as White Guilt. The neo puritanical belie,f that if one does not share your values, they must be morally and intellectually inferior to you. Which explains the arrogance and ''holier than thou'' attitude of so many liberalis. Snowflake. Much like their forbearers, the haughty slave holding Democrats and the smug self important Puritans, Liberals share the same conceited self centered opinions of others as less than themselves. AS for Republicans being racist lets review the facts:  are-hypocrites-on-slavery-racism-and-civil-rights/ I've said as much as I want to say to you. Bye.  	38	5

But much if not most of the world's population lives by the sea, imagine the chaos as all those people slowly became refugees. What's worse the land that remains would be hit by more extreme weather, droughts, heat waves, powerful storms like you can't imagine. Many of the species could not adapt and it would fuck up the entire global ecosystem, especially in the oceans there would be a lot of dying since the CO2 would turn them quite acidic. It would not be the end but it would make Earth a much shittier place to live, with a small chance of getting out of control and actually killing us all. So....burger anyone?  	3	2

LOL Worryng over small spelling mistakes in this format is picayune and is a dodge to really dicuss matters honestly. As for being a racist. You are the racist Snowflake! Steeped in anti white hate. Admit it. You are a bonefide bigot. You hate white people.!! Huh, Snowflake If you weren't such a neo puritan judgemental bigot. I would tell you, I would have as easy a time slamming the door in the face of European, Chinese and any other person not already here. As for Liberals I'd turn them into Soylent Green.

2016-09-28 21:37:08	Timiny Cricket	What this video didn't seem to mention is that the change it's showing would take thousands of years. People wouldn't be running from the encroaching waters. It would be a slow, methodical shift over centuries. We would also open up new habitable areas in , , and Antarctica which had been too cold to live in before. Shorelines would change, but people would be fine due to it being such a gradual change.  	5	3

2016-08-10 15:53:19	Derek Press	actually it would never get this far ,the rising sea levels and colder water would cause a shift of the Gulf Stream sending the north of Europe and then the whole of the north of the Earth back into an ice age, as well as pushing the Guls Stream back and slowing it down the fresh water that will be flowing into the Atlantic from  and the N. pole is lighter than salt water and would tend to float on the top and would freeze faster in winter this will then reflect the sun's heat during the Spring and at the beginning it would ony melt back slightly in mid summer,and will eventually become permanent all year round,yes places will start to flood but at some point the North Atlantic will be one big ice rinke and then the ice age will kick in, so,,,,,,,, sorry to say mate you will be covered in hundreds of meters of snow and ice,the ice would probably reach as far down as the north of Spain and would last for between 10 to 30,000 years, the people of the northern European countries(including the Scots) will most probably migrate to Africa within the first years of the beginning,there will be a massive food shortage and many wars ,just thought I let you know  	31	6

2016-08-17 04:16:17	Burnt Cheeto	+ Kelly Floridas beach is all beach when this occurs. Sure it won't be EXACTLY like this, but Florida is awfully close to sea level in most parts, so Florida probably mostly will flood and take everything that was in any city in the area down with the waves. And any rivers that connect to the ocean will flood and an water source in general that is connected to the ocean will flood, so the Midwest isn't as safe as you would think. St. Louis might still be there but the Mississippi River will cover much more land. The Great Lakes will also begin to flood, so Chicago and any other cities by the lakes will be in danger. Sure this will all take decades to even begin but it will occur. Industrial areas that produce mor carbon dioxide and eally aren't changing too much, are jjst making it worse. Humanity how it is, is just speeding this process up. If we can lower carbon emissions the process can be slowed, and stop anh extinction and death this could cause.  	31	3

2016-08-24 08:56:24	Levi For Waifu	@ There are problems with solar\renewable. (Technically solar isn't renewable, it's just nearly infinite by our standards.) First, potency. Solar panel turns 11% of it's energy absorbed into power. This can be raised as was done on the  rovers, but is not worth the cost. We would need a lot of panels. Or mirrors or whatnot. Tre dirty to manufacture and would need rare Earths that we're running out of (and where China has an exclusive claim.) Second reliability. Enough said. Third is cost. Much higher than any fossils, and if we stopped using, the rest of he world would only use more. Readmore about this in "The Prisoner's Dilemma".  	11	2
2016-08-24 07:30:59	Rory Dakin	Did you know that every day, the earth is hit with enough solar radiation to meet our current power demands for nearly a year (if we only had the storage capacity). It's actually currently possible for us to be entirely on solar power. However free energy, by definition, is not profitable. So that's a problem for the people being paid to make the rules and set the standards.  	20	2

2016-07-10 04:05:17	Jabir Jabir	However, we have to remember that much of our electricity is in fact from our fossil fuels. If we ran out of fossil fuel our entire society would likely collapse due to the lack of any viable power sources capable of supporting an entire seven billion people. At that point it will not be possible to mine any  since most of the world will be focusing on surviving and any scientists would be without any infrastructure needed to begin extra-planetary mining. At best society will be doomed to life in a pre-steam, agrarian world and at worst will be completely nonexistent due to a last minute nuclear exchange and any subsequent wars. :( Show less  	3	2

2016-08-12 19:48:16	valar	@ Norseman All of the ice theoretically could melt, although it would take centuries. The real concerns for our lifetimes are places like Bangladesh, Florida, Louisiana etc. where a few inches of sea level rise could make the difference between staying put and evacuation. Miami is already having problems with sewage being pushed up through the sewers and basements flooding in every storm.  	5	6
2016-08-12 17:28:48	Travis Norseman	the water bulges around the equator and as the ice melts, the weight is lifted off and the ground would rise. I'm not sure how accurate there model is anyway, the shifting weight would have dramatic effects on the ground, rotation, axis and wobble of the earth. not to mention that all the ice melting is super unlikely because the major ice build up is still effected by the amount of sunlight a particular area gets in a year. way to many variables to acount for IMO. this is just a scenario for fun, taking it seriously is foolish.  	5	6

If global ing starts really making a dent in global food production,  will become even more important. We are ideally situated to suffer less from global ing, ironically for this video. Our output might even increase. Centre of scientific and technological innovation - Google's largest headquarters outside the US is right here in my city! Widely respected as a model of what a nation-state can be. I get that you're trying to troll me, but really, do your research.

2016-06-08 07:00:55	glen Cochrane	I am curious what this is based on. There have been multiple times, in Earth's history, when the polar ice caps were completely melted.  	5	6
2016-06-14 05:55:54	glen Cochrane	Ridiculous. Back in the early 80's, supposed experts predicted that Florida would be completely under water by the year 2000. In the 90's, the same experts claimed that methane, produced from domesticated farm animals, was contributing to global ing (i.e. cow farts). The fact is, there is not enough water, frozen at the poles, to accomplish what this video is claiming, if all that ice melted.  	20	6
2016-06-14 01:27:20	glen Cochrane	+Scarlet Banner That's a rather simple answer; unfortunately, it leaves too many factors out of the equation. Too many of these ridiculous predictions fail to take into account water table acclimation, seasonal effects, density, fresh water accumulation... these factors would definitely change the outcome of this unscientific model. I hope you can do better than that😟  	5	3

2016-08-07 19:42:39	DELTA Δ	We don't have that much information on Antarctica's elevation if you take out all the ice, plus as  lives there so the human cost is negligible.  	5	6
2016-06-06 10:22:58	ajwasp	+pd it is a huge mountainous continent underneath the ice there. It is the  Pole! A huge part the size of  would probably still be above sea level as much as the other land masses shown in the video. Only the North Pole is "ice only".  	5	6

2016-06-02 04:30:14	ZenRules	i like how everyone is focusing on the water rising threat yet  knows about that if the poles melt the currents will stop which will cause your not so friendly neighborhood sun to keep burning it and as that happens the planktons will release more co2 the water temperature will drastically rise which keeps us in a living hell unless we do something about it we will have to take a trip to kepler-186ff which has plenty of ice left  	31	6
2016-06-06 03:40:41	ZenRules	its already too late to stop it , the red tide is the biggest clue  	31	3

2016-06-01 16:00:00	umvhu	If ALL the ice melted then there would be a very big increase in air temperature and as air temperature increases it's ability to hold water vapour increases dramatically, therefore the rise in sea level would be far less than indicated by this animation (if it would rise at all :-) )  	5	6

I did look up Piers Corbyn and found this:  termite-wars-and-jeremy-corbyn-s-real-eu-views I found this about  Moore:  And it would appear that Ivar Giaever is the William Shockley* of the current generation:  pseudoscientist.html *Shockley was also a nobel laureate physicist who made a fool of himself by pontificating about matters outside his field of expertise:  shockley  	37	2
2016-06-14 16:47:39	dakippins	Look at the comment above. Im not tech savvy and dont know how to post links , but I urge you to look up - " " Piers Corbyn, on the  Marr show " , . "  Moore - Why I left greenpeace. " , and " Sceptics are the new thin green line " . " Ivar Giaever's Global ing hoax " . . . Do you really believe that we are all be wiped out in a slow (or quick) toxic, ecological disaster ? Really ? When ? Cos Al Gore told me we had a decade until its to late. Taht was 10 yrs ago.

2016-06-03 15:46:03	dakippins	Yes . I have seen a lot of science / sudo science and junk science. And while I wouldnt claim to have any great scientific mind, I HAVE seen how human nature operates. And its not honest. The people pointing the finger at all of humanity now for the original sin of being born, are the new clergy. High priests beyond reproach.

2016-06-02 13:11:14	dakippins	No . I live on a rain swept rock in the north east atlantic, . A land without seasons that can go years without seeing the sun.

2016-05-31 17:25:45	kenmystro	+ So you are disappointed that something that should happen over a millennia or centuries hasn't happened in the past few decades? Fail to see what the downside is cleaner air & oceans and more sustainable communities/cities aswell as renewable energy dealing a fatal blow to the monetary system and the chains that bind us. Don't think we need to worry about sea level rising though as by the time it does we will be pumped by some other means  	31	2
2016-05-31 15:54:51	johnmburt1960	@ I agree, the debate over AGW is boring. We keep telling you that burning fossil carbon is harming the planet, and you keep ignoring us because we're telling you something you don't want to hear. And while you go on fiddling, the ice continues to melt, melt, melt....  	20	2
2016-05-30 20:51:06	dakippins	I used to be naive. ive been listening to this end times climate change since the 1970s and forgive me, but after a while you start to feel like youve been suckered. Its like a religion. IE . Guilt by virtue of being born , but can be saved if you follow the prophets who can lead us all to salvation . Its fuckin boring, now  	20	2
2016-05-30 19:50:11	kenmystro	+ No they will not seeing as 90% of the worlds coral is suffering from bleaching, that means it's dying, and this is due to the sea being so acidic from the amount of carbon it has absorbed. It is hard to tell from your comment whether you are just trying to be optimistic or are totally naive. So please tell us what you think about the results from the ice core samples, the recent ones that go back millions of years  	5	6
2016-05-30 19:37:15	johnmburt1960	*"Sea levels have risen and fallen over millenia."* True, that has happened, *over millennia*. That they should rise over decades or even over years is something new, and terrifying.@  	31	3
2016-05-30 13:49:30	dakippins	Thats just what happens. Sea levels have risen and fallen over millenia. Swathes of coral reef have disapeared after the last sea level drop. Maybe they'll come back with this rise  	5	3

2016-05-19 00:53:42	YamatoFukkatsu	Finally, a more realistic model. I mean, you gotta consider, the Antarctic ice cap is supposedly around 2 miles high at its thickest, and the Arctic ice cap is barely a fraction of that. You have all that melt, spread it out over the entirety of the planet, and it's really not going to add to the sea level by quite that much (this isn't even taking into account that water expands when it freezes). Not to say that global ing shouldn't be made light of, but I'm sick of all these god damn doomsday theorists acting as if the peak of Mt. Everest will be the only dry land left (Everest from sea level being about 2 and a half times the height of the Antarctic cap; even if all that water somehow covered the planet without ever decreasing in height, there'd still be over half of Everest remaining as well as several other mountainous regions).  	31	6

Unless you meant this: Ice has a low albino, therefore it will reflect more heat than the higher albino sea or land which absorbs a lot of heat. Therefore, if the ice melts, it will expose the sea, which has a higher albino, which would heat up the earth more. Not to mention there would not be as much heat reflected.  	5	6

2016-06-16 12:08:49	Hua En	+ You mean if it got much hotter, all the ice would melt. The ice does not cause temperatures to rise, temperatures rising causes the ice to melt.  	5	6

2016-05-17 20:07:15	Thomas Ramsey	@ Sullivan There are no land masses below the North Pole. You must be confusing it with the  Pole, which does have land under the ice, though very far down. So when or if all the ice in the world melts, the land under the south pole will still be covered with the risen water levels.  	5	6

Then the 2030 goal for carbon reduction set out in paris, well china plans to meet those targets by 2025, if not earlier.

2016-05-10 04:03:27	Rich D	+ not much, surface-area-wise much less. The entire continent needs to rebound back up out of the mantel because there's so much ice it's pushing the land down. It could take thousands of years for the land to rebound back up. So during that whole time it will be in the ocean.  	5	6

2016-05-10 04:07:22	Rich D	+ Kind of. The ice will melt much faster than the continent can rebound back out of the mantel, so much of it will be under the ocean too.  	5	6
2016-05-08 20:40:02	John Wang	Apparently, this is based on current elevations as indicated by the inland lake in  projected to increase in size. However, due to the spin of the Earth, the water would tend to flow more towards the equatorial regions than the polar and the presumably er climate would thaw the perma-frost resulting in an elevation drop and perhaps significant erosion in regions near the poles.

2016-05-07 18:11:02	Ishaq Niz	@ ice melts the ice water will go in sea and i will work as catalyst to fasten the process of condensation and evaporation more condensation reason massive amount of sweet water willl result huge condensation means more cool result rapid ice age faster than expected and world will not be ready for it i saw this documentary in national geogic  	5	6
2016-05-07 17:42:14	Ole Tim Herr	yes there will be a cycle. but we'll have to wait a long time for the ice age to come back. Right now, we live at the end of an ice age so expect temperatures to  up for thousands more years  	31	6

2016-05-14 22:56:42	Gordon Wiessner	My thoughts exactly, the r volume of ice doesn't equate properly. It appears this video does not show a proper volume to mass ratio conversion. Flooding would be far less than shown. A new Al Gore scare flick?  	5	6

2016-05-03 00:58:59	EAprima	There is only one MASSIVE problem with this.... If all the ice melted then the Earth's poles will change together with the Earth's tilt axis. Meaning, the positioning or up shore of water will be different around the world, and what was possibly in the hottest region due to the axis has a high possibility of shifting into slightly cooler areas and vice versa. I.e. The changes would be more disastrous or a game-changer than this video shows.  	5	6

2016-05-08 22:41:29	NotSoLoneWolf	@Mr. Dr. Sir  Swaggins The 3rd The 5th The 2nd I can't even understand what the fuck you just said. Since when? What is 'one to one'? Before what?  	19	5
2016-05-08 22:22:24	Daniel Knorr	@cannonfodder343 yes it correlates a little since then, but its not one to one, they both just show an up pattern, but before that it never correlated.  	19	5
2016-05-08 22:18:34	NotSoLoneWolf	@Mr. Dr. Sir  Swaggins The 3rd The 5th The 2nd How does this prove it is natural? All I see is the temperature going up steadily, with some expected drops and spikes as industrial production ed up for WWII, then Europe got the shit kicked out of it and all its factories were blown up.  	20	2
2016-05-08 21:59:22	Daniel Knorr	@cannonfodder343 yes something is going on but its natural, and my g is too big to see from 1997 to now, here look at this   	26	5
2016-05-08 18:45:37	NotSoLoneWolf	@Mr. Dr. Sir  Swaggins The 3rd The 5th The 2nd No, it hasn't, if you're talking about your chart by the geologist guy. And I'm done if you refuse to acknowledge that the planet is doing something weird, human caused or not.  	20	2
2016-05-08 17:51:43	Daniel Knorr	@cannonfodder343 and look it's been cooling down since 1997!  	36	2
2016-05-08 17:50:49	Daniel Knorr	@cannonfodder343 I'm done if you can't see that it doesn't correlate then your just denying logic  	37	5
2016-05-08 16:43:29	NotSoLoneWolf	@Mr. Dr. Sir  Swaggins The 3rd The 5th The 2nd The temperature has been low for over 65 million years, that's why life on Earth exists. It probably can't during the hot periods on the chart. That chart extends back to when the Earth was formed. It ends on the present day. If it was based on a model, then it would extend into the future. But it doesn't. On your chart, see how after that sharp drop in temperature, the CO2 levels are stable for hundreds of thousands of years? That period is the time when humanity has lived. But right now, the temperature is going up again, there have been too many droughts, heatwaves, and hurricanes in the last century, and hey, about a century ago, the CO2 levels that had stayed STABLE FOR HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF YEARS are rising, and quickly. The previous massive spikes are when the Earth was new, developing, and had  slamming into it left right and centre from a new and developing solar system. A planet the size of mars actually collided with the Earth at some point. Earth had barely any plants, and when it did are was starting to be stable, another asteroid breached the atmospheric shield and wiped it out. Cue more instability, then a new wave of plants stabilize the atmosphere, and one day, some monkeys decide to walk on their hind legs. This gives their heads more support, which allows their brains to become bigger. Tool use and rapid evolution soon follows. Even if you don't believe that we are causing it, you have to at least agree that something is out of whack, somewhere, and we need urgent action to either fix it or adapt to it.  	31	2
2016-05-07 19:03:29	Daniel Knorr	@cannonfodder343 I would like to see a source, and I bet it's based off of modles not accuall data witch the NOAA is actually using when displaying this kind of information, and if it really does correlate then why is there a massive spike in mine where the co2 is high and the temp is very low!  	20	2
2016-05-07 03:05:02	NotSoLoneWolf	@Mr. Dr. Sir  Swaggins The 3rd The 5th The 2nd Hey, I also found an awesome chart on his website that supports Climate Change.  Take a look at the very top. If you look closely, there is a gigantic spike in the last century or so, moving up much faster than any other change in climate on that chart. How is that explained?  	20	2
2016-05-07 02:45:41	Daniel Knorr	@cannonfodder343 thats my point, he studies ice cores and tree rings  	15	2
2016-05-07 02:40:09	NotSoLoneWolf	@Mr. Dr. Sir  Swaggins The 3rd The 5th The 2nd WOW! I look up 's wiki page, and guess what? Not only is he a GEOLOGIST, which isn't Climatology, but he works at the University of... Drumroll please... TEXAS!!! HAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAH  	20	2
2016-05-07 02:25:14	Daniel Knorr	@cannonfodder343 right after that it says BY dr. c. r. scotese the whole thing said "from Analysis of the Temperature Oscillations in Geological Eras by Dr. C. R. Scotese"  	20	2
2016-05-07 02:16:37	NotSoLoneWolf	@Mr. Dr. Sir  Swaggins The 3rd The 5th The 2nd Well, at the bottom of the image it said "from Analysis of the Temperature Oscillations in Geological Eras", so I googled that and got a paper written by the herbal .  	35	2
2016-05-07 02:02:50	Daniel Knorr	@cannonfodder343 Also the maker of the gs name is dr. c. r. scotese, you google him, and he is a geologist, one who studies tree rings, and ice cores and looks at Co2 and temperature levels! Tell me how you came up with a self appointed herbal guy!  	20	2
2016-05-07 02:00:22	Daniel Knorr	@cannonfodder343 fox news is real news, you can say the same about Bernie and Hillary too! They have both been on fox too!  	2	5
2016-05-07 01:13:38	NotSoLoneWolf	Let me pick your reply apart one by one. That first image, I traced it back to its scientific paper, written by one Nasif Nahle. If you google "nasif nahle legit?" look what we have here: "A profile of the author Nasif Nahle on Wikipedia reveals his principle expertise to be in the field of herbal medicine….not climate physics! Furthermore he appears to be a (self-appointed) “Professor” of a small back alley lab, one without any official backing, i.e. not a university, etc." Secondly, Joe Bastardi: "Bastardi is also a Senior Advisor at the n Tradition Institute (ATI), a group denounced by the n Association for the Advancement of Science for contributing to an 'environment that inhibits the free exchange of scientific findings and ideas.'" Like Nahle, he has no degree in climate physics, he's a glorified weatherman.  He has also made almost 20 appearances on Fox News. When False News has a guy come on two dozen times, you know he's not legit.  	20	2
2016-05-06 16:09:07	Daniel Knorr	@cannonfodder343 sorry wi fi problems...  tell me after looking at this that Co2 and temperature correlates. Also look over s twitter, his name is Joe Bastardi, he went to pen state, witch is number one in the U.S for their Meteorology program.   	20	2
2016-05-06 15:11:24	Daniel Knorr	@cannonfodder343 i ment temp or temperature  	36	5
2016-05-06 03:32:25	NotSoLoneWolf	@Mr. Dr. Sir  Swaggins The 3rd The 5th The 2nd What is a 'thenpy'? And the research has been clear for years - the planet is getting shafted by human activity. When I asked for proof, I meant a link to a research paper telling me that global ing is a hoax.  	20	2
2016-05-06 02:56:19	Daniel Knorr	@cannonfodder343 yes tre rising but thenpy haven't correlated until now  	4	5
2016-05-06 01:09:10	NotSoLoneWolf	@Mr. Dr. Sir  Swaggins The 3rd The 5th The 2nd ...Because  ever researched what rising CO2 levels would do, until, you know, CO2 levels actually rose.  	20	2

2016-04-27 08:42:04	Rob England	These are ridiculously extreme scenarios. The WORST case scenario for the IPCC report was 1m by the end of the century. Assuming nothing is done. Assuming no technology is developed to reverse the process. These pictures are 70 metre sea level rises which even if it happens isn't going to happen for a long time and most likely won't happen at all.   I'm not a climate change denier but let's stick to the science  	31	2

So when the ice melts, nothing would really happen because theres less pressure on the water. Good simulation though.  	33	6

2016-05-15 13:16:39	Phanaios Apollon	+ It's already a lake, though only after plenty of rain. Normally it's just a salt pan. Anyway, it wouldn't be a land-locked lake, it would an inlet of the Ocean, a sea unto itself like the Mediterranean or Black Sea today. I presume there must be some channel to the Ocean which wasn't shown on the map, for whatever reason. The lake/salt-pan is Lake Eyre and it is very low-lying, which is why it would flood. Actually, it is currently about 15 metres BELOW sea-level, so if it were connected to the ocean it would fill up very well! I presume it's a salt-pan because it once was flooded by the ocean in the past.  	30	3

Hey you know, if the world ended, how different would that be from just dieing? I mean think about it, we've always been afraid of death. Sure, if the world ended then we'd all be dead. But then... Just how different would that be? I mean if scientists are correct we are just this amazing little accident on tiny little blip in the timeline of the . Existence or unexistence, doesn't really matter so much. I mean why do humans HAVE to exist?      If it does come to that, well... I'm just gonna spend my time praying to God, and trying to ease people's suffering. I'm a somewhat wealthy person, if shit hit the fan I would be able to provide for some people. I mean think about it, if we're all gonna die we might as well make it as easy as possible for everyone, right?      Really we act like everything is just so horrible. But the Earth will bounce back in around 10,000 years time. Yeah that's forever to us, but to the Earth that's nothing. And if you wanna stay optimist, there have been species to survive a gigantic asteroid that caused a planet-wide explosion. Who knows, maybe some of us will be able to find a way to pull through? And also, it's not like the planet has never been super hot before. The planets been hotter than it is right now, the planets been way colder than it is right now too.      Sometimes I think about all of the doomsayers who predict that "ON THIS DATE, WE WILL ALL DIE!" You know, like Y2k and 2012. And I think to , how can you be so stupid? Unless we're hit by an asteroid the world won't end in one day. Even in the Book of the Apocolypse (Revelation) the world doesn't die in one day. It's stupid to insist that we'll all somehow die out in one brisk breeze. No, some of us will be around to suffer through.      So who knows? I don't, so I'm not going to pretend that I do and be scared about it. I'm just going to do my part, try to inform people. Recycle as much as I can. Go as green as I can. I mean what else can I do? Maybe I could do some phone-banking, try to talk and convince people that we need this. Might as well.  	31	2

2016-03-19 08:19:09	Jazelle Hall	It needs to be noted the earth has had both ice caps melt several times in geological history before. fossils located in many inland areas (low lying not raised due to earth lifting) show salt water life hence inland seas. this is also why there are great inland salt deposits. Florida is basically a very long sand spit so it makes sense it would be under water at least every few millions of years. Ice ages are often followed by periods of nearly no ice. the ethical is a living thing and we can not force it to stop its cycles just so we can be comfortable. Like all living things we have to adapt to survive. Our recorded data on the weather and temperature changes are truly only a few hundred years old. during that time science has changed both they way it is recorded and the data received. Records before that time are not from instruments but obervations from mainly laymen or historical events, the rest is from tree or other data. After that is more long term with a few hundred to several thousand year errors using fossils and earth layered recording. Often scientists will state this data tells this results only later to change as say they were first wrong. Now having said all of this I more subscribe to a belief we can affect and change. of all the living creatures on this plant we have survived from eating and using poisons. in truth we are the best poisoners created. each of us can change that by taking care of our part of the planet. we can not change the earth's cycles but we can clean up and make sure we are enriching and not poisoning.  	31	2

2016-02-24 12:02:09	jens jensen	first i doubt that all of the ice could ever melt and if it did not all would go in the oceans but also into lakes (higher water level makes more lakes in current valleys and flat lands) as a Dane I'm sure most of Denmark would go away, but remember that Antarctica would now be a new continent for humanity.. also even if Florida is kinda flat i doubt it would all go away even with a 65 meter increase in ocean heights, also the ocean have risen over the last 20 years with a 3,2 mm so this would likely take 200/1000 years to happen, so relocation is possible. maybe this could be good for us. would likely make the isolated fresh water of the poles move to the oceans or the land solving some of our fresh water problems, info taking from national geogic   	31	6
2016-02-24 10:51:34	EdofJville	The likelihood of all of the planet's ice melting is very slim as it would take hundreds of years to happen and surely humanity would have managed to slow down and even stop the emission of greenhouse gases within that timeframe so this scenario depicted here is unlikely to occur.      On a sidenote, all of the Florida hate and bashing on here and throughout YouTube and other parts of the internet is unwarranted and just plain ridiculous. Florida isn't the only place in the USA or even the world where weird incidents and crimes happen and not all Floridians are Republicans or Bible-thumping creationists. In fact, most of the 20 million plus people of the 3rd most populated state in the country are registered Democrats and Independents are increasing every year, all of whom are progressive-minded individuals.      What happened in 2000 is in the past and hating on people from any particular state or country in the world is wrong and pointless. Don't lump all people from a certain location or background into one group. Every person is an individual. The fetish/habit of Florida bashing that started on Reddit and 4chan and that has spread throughout other sites including YouTube really needs to stop already as it is utterly pointless and gotten to the point of being annoying and just plain stupid.      As human beings regardless of nationality, race, gender, or economic class, we should be lifting each other up and uniting under common ground, not knocking each other down. All of us share Earth. Don't use the internet as an excuse to be stupid, though I fully realize that will always be an issue no matter what as there will always be fools among us.      Also, vote Bernie Sanders in 2016 to move away from oil and to renewable resources to help stop carbon emissions globally. Don't give in to fear, ignorance, and hatred. Reject the divisiveness of  and the establishment corruption of Hillary Clinton. Good people support unity, dialog, and understanding for all of humanity. Bernie Sanders is the only viable candidate for president this election year.      Support rationality. Support positive change. Support tolerance and understanding. Support justice. Protect and preserve the planet.      #FeeltheBern  	31	2

2016-03-13 00:57:29	Brian_007	+The BOSS bro...bro........BBBRRRRRRRROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOUUUuuuuuuuu....The Ice in the North can melt, stay still, smoke some weed and evaporate, I don't care, the only ones that will be affected are polar bears and s, it is already part of the ocean, a change in its state of matter will not affect the sea level at all cause all that would change is the amount of volume, but the total mass(melted glaciers and already existing ocean) will remain the same. It's the  Pole you need to worry about, the ice outside the border of the Antarctic landmass is again, not an issue, it's the ice on top of Antarctica melting as it slides off into the ocean that is a problem since it is NEW mass added onto the world's oceans, it was not there before, so that will naturally add to the sea level.  	31	6

2016-03-16 22:13:31	Joe Swanson	@ Hello, I know you were referring to his comment via the G+ reply reference. What he said is dead wrong, but I find it skeptical that water levels are increasing that much. I have not done much (or any) research to how NASA calculates there totals. Do you have sources that provide a back- up to this claim of a 3-inch increase (with methodology included)?  	33	2
2016-03-13 17:52:50	Eric Moomjean	@ I was responding to piehamcakes1's comment where he stated that ocean levels went down by .3 inches in the last 10 years. So the factor of 10 and scope of years is entirely related to the context of his comment.  	5	3
2016-03-13 17:41:20	Joe Swanson	+ Don't know where you are getting that from that link. As of the present, NASA is reporting 3.41 mm per year (roughly .134 inches). As this peak-level of increase, this is only around 2.6 inches over 20 years. Since it has not been dramatically rising at this pace over the last 20 years, I would estimate the rise is considerably lower. Even though it shows roughly a 76 mm difference, you are not considering the lowering sea levels before 1997.  	31	2
2016-03-11 00:56:30	Eric Moomjean	+piehamcake1 Actually you have that backwards and off by a factor of 10 (NASA data shows a sea level increase of 3 inches over the past 20yrs):   	5	3

Climate global changing er ice age is all BS! If you think it is real, look up the temperature in DC the day Lincoln was shot! Or how deep the ice was in the Arctic in 1914. Or how many Hurricanes there were in 1899. How many acres of forest fire burned in 1776? What was the level of Co2 the day Jesus was born? If you can't find the answers to those easy questions, you have no idea what is normal and what is man caused changes that can be fixed by spending money...Earth=Billion years old. Mankind=20,000 years or so. Records of climate=135 years. Digitally accurate records=50 years.  	20	2

2016-02-03 22:04:56	Victor Pedersen	If all ice melted, the world will not be flooded. The new water just covers the ice place. The reason for growing meters in water it's because it reached temperature over 7 degrees Celsius. Hot things expands. Then the water has more mass and overlap the land.  	5	6

2016-02-03 14:25:37	Arthur SOLA	scary map! D:   but its impossible because the ice take more place than water so the ocean won't rise   (do your experience:   freeze a entire bottle of water and melt it and after the water will come down)  	5	6
2016-03-13 19:42:16	Craig Boden	Add to that that ice in a bottle or container isn't subjected to tons of more ice on top of it compacting it further. Thousands upon thousands of square miles of ice melting really would be a massive problem. We still also don't really know how thick most of it is either so there could be a he'll of a lot more than we realise.  	33	6
2016-02-27 16:20:23	shmaveyea	Most of the ice sits on land, do your own experiments* and read a fucking book  	5	6
2016-02-05 08:24:49	Corentin	Yeah but there are ice caps on land (not floating in the sea), so if they melt, water will run to the sea and sea level will rise  	5	6

2016-02-03 04:56:46	Jackson Porter	Just kidding the reason the sea level is rising is because the existing water is getting er and expanding no ice melting. This is because I've is less dense than water and it floats so when it melts in a cup for example the level will be the same when you put the cubes in as 3 hours later when it has melted  	5	6

2016-02-01 18:49:25	Yellow Shirt Productions	Nice propaganda film. Here's a little experiment for you all. Take a clear bucket and fill it up most of the way. Now fill up the rest with ice to the brim. Wait awhile and let the ice melt. You will notice that the bucket does not overflow, this is because ice has more volume frozen than as liquid. If the ice melts the net gained or lost is insignificant in the non government study.  	33	6
2016-04-10 18:46:50	Sampige Man	+ yes okay nice experiment. totally irrelevant. I have one for you. Fill your bucket all the way up and hang ice above it.  	33	6
2016-03-24 02:50:48	Mike js	+ Nooo, while that is accurate most of earth's ice sits ON LAND, thus, when it melts, draining to the oceans, a fact that is commonly overlooked. This negates the argument of equal volume.  	5	6
2016-02-05 08:29:13	Corentin	You're doing it with ice already in the water, but what if I told you most ice is actually on the lands, and therefore not floating?  	33	6

2016-01-29 12:55:56	Itz_NotMick	I don't think anything will really happen to the world, because isn't the mass of the ice already there? and if the ice melts wouldn't the ice's mass stay the same?  	5	6
2016-04-10 18:37:59	Sampige Man	+XDmemehero 2324 Plus, when the ice melts in your cup, the water level will drop. Yes the mass of all the water combined states the same, but that doesn't have any influence on this at all.  	33	6
2016-04-07 01:21:38	Auke Brinkman	+XDmemehero 2324 you don't understand his point. The ice on land doesn't touch the oceans. So when it melts, it's NEW mass, so therefore the mass of the water will become bigger, and therefore the water will rise.  	33	6
2016-02-01 22:52:19	Itz_NotMick	try it with some water and ice put some water in a cup and then put ice into the water, the water will go higher because the ice's mass will be added to the water. when the ice melts i am sure that the water level will stay the same.  	33	6
2016-02-01 22:50:44	Itz_NotMick	but the mass is already with the land and if it melts it will still be the same because the mas was always there but changed places  	5	6
2016-02-01 12:27:33	Itz_NotMick	+Thian Tromp but wont the mass add on to the lands mass?  	11	1
2016-01-31 10:37:23	Thianosaurus Rex	The mass is not in the water at the moment it is on land, only if it melts it will run into the water.  	33	3
2016-01-30 16:35:21	Itz_NotMick	i mean that mass cant change if it is already there.  	26	1
2016-01-30 16:34:04	Itz_NotMick	but if that mass is already there will it make more mass when it melts? that is what i am saying  	33	6

And the Antarctic climate has not changed during the last 5 million years, unaffected by the comings and goings of ice ages and  periods. Obviously it is not likely to change anytime soon... soo this will always be a fantacy animation....   Next time try this: "What if all CO2 was gone?" \--- All plant life would die within a year or two -- and eventually all life on earth would stop to exist. In case you didn't know: CO2 is the most important "food" for plant life on earth -- which in turn is food for all of us.... Did I hear someone say CO2 is a polutant? ...then you better not breath out -- cos what comes out of your mouth is CO2..... Scary! :)  	20	2

This isn't a massive flood tsunami that will wipe out millions of people, it is a slow gradual rising of water and moving of the shoreline. That said, you WOULD have to relocate all of those people, which would cost untold trillions and wreak utter havoc on the global economy with traditional trading areas being gone. Not to mention that this doesn't even take into account and actual rise in temperatures.  	31	3

2016-01-17 00:30:05	RechargeableLithium	+Monir sen Bouker Yes - there does appear to have been times in the Earth's past when the poles were free of ice. Unfortunately, it's NEVER happened in the 200,000 or so years that humans have existed - and the climate on the planet that would result in iceless poles would be too hot to grow the foods we all live on - corn, wheat, soy - too hot for seeds to set. What could possibly be bad about that? And no - Al Gore didn't predict squat - he simply wrote and talked about what science knew at the time - which, oddly enough, is vastly different than the messages sent by the climate denial industry. Fact check - please - it's good for you.  	31	2

Or did it only take the volume of water in the ice and raise the sea levels by an equivalent volume? If it's the second, then your calculations are wrong and this is not what would happen. In reality, some areas would experience sea level rise while others would experience a drop in sea level.  	5	6

2016-01-11 21:00:25	Jeremy Sun	A meter thick of ice is really only 10 cm thick of water. The entire  glacier can probably fit into one of the great lakes, in terms of volume.  	5	6
2016-01-11 20:59:04	Jeremy Sun	Warmer air would go more water. Humidity in the air would increase with higher temperature. A lot of melted land glacier simply stays up in a er air and won't come down as rain.  	5	6
2016-01-11 20:57:58	Jeremy Sun	If you think about it. When land glaciers melt. What happens to that water? That water gets evaporated and goes into the air. Yeah some of that can come down as rain somewhere, but you don't know where, could be over land somewhere, could be over the ocean somewhere, could be over a lake somewhere. The point I'm trying to make is, not all of the melted land glacier would go into the ocean.  	5	6
2016-01-11 20:53:13	Jeremy Sun	Consider this. Humans only inhabit something like 0.1% of all the land. If climate does get er, a lot of currently too cold land would be habitable. The net gain would be huge. Think about it. Alaska is like a quarter the size of the US and less well under a million people. If global ing does cause all ice to melt, Alaska would be able to accommodate hundreds of millions of people.  	5	6

2016-05-07 17:40:15	Ole Tim Herr	deserts are created because of their latitude. 30 degrees north and 30 degrees south is the areas of dry arid land mostly because of coriolis and how moisture flows from region to region, while the edges of the deserts will green up, the vast majority will most likely stay dry  	30	3

2016-02-01 23:27:30	Benjamin Abruzzo	@ Well, a part of the "global ing" phenom is the heating of the planet, allowing it to hold more water, thus higher humidity. But yes, as long as the mountains block the airflow, some deserts will remain dry. The thing is, you can see in the video that many mountain ranges are lowered in relation to sea level, changing the barrier.  	5	3
2016-02-01 23:06:44	Göker Çakır	+ Abruzzo "Green" is not affected by water only. Humidity and heat are much more decisive factors. (I'm studying geogy)  	36	2

2016-01-27 23:39:56	Benjamin Abruzzo	@ "On top of basic logic, global ing will ensure that the deserts will not only stay static, but expand." Because most deserts are the result of land features such as sea level vs mountains and distance to shore, the flooding of many land masses would result in more moisture reaching deserts. It is very likely that the deserts could return to their various stages of vegetation over time. Or become a vat area of mud rather than dry. Just because it's hot doesn't mean the evaporation and precipitation cycle will stop. " won't mean the whole desert will magically become lush jungles"  said anything about magic. But as long as we are playing with imaginary "global ice melt", which in all reality would take decades to centuries, we can presume plant life will adapt as well.  	31	6
2016-01-27 22:53:20	Guts Likes It In The Ass	LoL, just because a couple hundred km2 get's under the sea, won't mean the whole desert will magically become lush jungles. On top of basic logic, global ing will ensure that the deserts will not only stay static, but expand.  	5	3
2016-01-13 04:37:35	Ben Rieber	+ Abruzzo Although I do agree that this video is partly incomplete, this video is only focusing on the rise in sea levels if the polar ice caps melted, not on climate change.  	5	6

2016-01-04 18:59:51	olynxmano	1\. Ice and water have the same mass. Melt Ice cubes in a glass, and you will see, no ascending waterlevels. 2. Ice, as you find on frozen earth, also hasn't that density of pure water! . 3. Below the ice you find huge caverns that will be flooded ...So, If really all Ice melted, the water level will go down, not up. 4. also, loose gases that have been stored in the oceans, will be released into the atmosphere... and so on... The real problem of raising the Waterlevel, is the Dirt that Rivers transport to the Seas . Every huge Storm washes earth from any countrypart , ending up in flushing continously into the seas. Waves cut directly land from Isles... and so on. Also, if all Ice melted and the higher "Waterpercentage" in the Air cuts off the cooling down of deserts in the night, Africa may become fully green again.  	31	6

2016-01-22 21:26:20	Martin Poulter	+ Consider ice floating in water. When it melts, it doesn't affect the level of the water at all, because ice is less dense than water and because of Archimedes' Principle. Now consider ice that's on top of land, like the ice ts of  and Antarctica that are miles thick. As that ice turns to water, it will run into the sea.

2015-12-24 09:24:06	genxman fromthe1980s	I can't believe that my favorite city on the East Coast: Charleston, SC, I stripped going to be gone in my lifetime! That's depressing! I have many fond memories of Charleston, SC, and especially Isle Of Palms, from my childhood, on vacations back in the 1980's! It's not fair! One of the coolest places on the East Coast will be gone probably by 2050! The ocean level in Charleston, SC, has risen substantially just since the 1970 census! To put things into perspective, I was born in 1978. Therefore, the Atlantic Ocean has risen that much just in all of lifetime, and will be at the point of submersion when I reach retirement age. I can always go vacation in Augusta, GA, and Aiken, SC. That part of present-day eastern GA, and the Sandhills of the Midlands of SC will be the new Atlantic East Coast by 2050! Unbelievable! Absolutely unbelievable! I can't believe that this is happening: and so fast too! This is the shocking part down there in Charleston, SC too! Being a SC native , I have noticed the landscape of Charleston changing just in my lifetime: so far! Sad! We're going to lose a gem of an historic n city indeed!  	30	9

2015-12-17 04:22:49	Ben	Why would water levels go up? Doesn't ice take up more  than water, so shouldn't water levels go down if anything.  	33	6
2016-01-17 04:22:41	Chris94 _NOR	+Ben It was like that during the last Ice Age. During the last Ice Age, the ocean was lower, due to more ice. For an example, you could walk from continental Europe and over to the UK, because the English Channel was not covered in water. It was dry land.  	5	6
2015-12-17 19:45:53	Martin Poulter	+Ben Ice that's on land and melts, runs into the sea, raising sea levels.  and Antarctica have huge ice ts on top of land. Hope that answers your question.  	5	6

2016-04-10 18:40:29	Sampige Man	+ If all the ice caps were completely under water, it would only lower the sea level. But it's mostly all above sea level thus filling the sea.  	5	6

2016-06-07 04:32:01	G. Wayne	@ Wochele Did you forget about the effect that CO2 has on the acidity of the oceans? And what about how we have been manipulating AGW so much that absorption is now reaching a point when less is able to be absorbed by the saturated oceans.  	20	2
2016-06-07 04:19:52	Faizan Ahmed	No it's not. Main driver is human activity. Their is already a consensus on it AND there is a consensus on the consensus itself. Read up on the facts at NASA's website (and other credible science websites) and stop spewing the partial bullshit.  	20	2

2016-06-05 05:23:03	john carlisle	@​ we went out this morning to check on our locations, I lost one, and am intrigued, when I get back I plan on renting scuba gear and a waterproof camera. In the meantime I need to get a larger group and check more lakes, but from everything we learned today, I have no s for what I fear for my children and children's children's future... I was supposed to be studying Portuguese and instead mulled over who to recruit, who to share the data we have found, and bodies of water closer to fracking sites and debated economics on youtube... Monday however I get to go to work on the Belo Monte Dam on the Xingu River. I just hope I'll have Internet access so I can watch the elections on the 7th... and I'll have plenty of deet ( Repel 100) lol ﻿  	30	3
2016-06-05 05:08:01	G. Wayne	I too believe that rivers are especially vulnerable to the effects of hydraulic fracturing as tre on fault lines created a long time ago. Enjoy your trip.Probably something to remember for a lifetime. I would.  	11	3
2016-06-04 06:59:53	john carlisle	@ yes, although I realise that vegatative compounds can release methane, I also believe that rivers and lakes are most susceptible to hydraulic fracking, if we can locate these breaches, and recorder them, we have a higher probability of reversing the fracking protections and will have a greater chance of making the practice illegal. Hopeful thinking I know, but thanks to you I am not focusing on cycling but canoeing with lighters and GPS lol  	30	3
2016-06-04 06:33:03	G. Wayne	@ sle Yes, fracking can cause such releases almost anywhere near any fracking operation, but they will never admit to it even if it was not evident before the operation as they do not desire any bad news brought to the fracking world as it is rampant with abuses that never come to light.It can only bring worse conditions anywhere it is allowed to happen.  	11	2
2016-06-04 06:29:53	G. Wayne	This methane can be captured and depending on how much is produced in the bonnet at low enough pressures that can be used to create power or by just heating water or an area close by ,but is best burned as it should never be allowed to enter the biosphere where it will only cause worse problems.  	11	2
2016-06-04 06:09:37	john carlisle	@​ thank you, I will look deeper into this, this past week a group of friends and I have taken canoes out looking for bubbles in a nearby lake, and the goal was to just set them on fire and observe. I found 2 patches and they remained alight for 1.) An hour and half, we relighted and it fizzled out, the other 2.) Continued to burn and we are checking on it tomorrow. Unfortunately I have to go to  in 2 days. I feel fracking may play a part in this, but I can't rule out degrading compounds. If we can harness this CH4 then maybe we can profit and reverse it's negative effects, area 1.) Is located, tomorrow we will locate the source, if it's plant based, we'll remove and compost it. Keep up the amazing work, the world needs people like you ﻿  	30	2
2016-06-04 05:53:58	G. Wayne	@ sle The aquatic growth has been mechanically removed or killed using expensive chemicals before now. My answer is to localize anaerobic batch digestors near to where the growth is harvested and used to create by fermentation a bio gas rich enough in methane to use to operate a generator to make electricity and once the digesting is finished the effluent is a fertilizer with all of the humus,potash and other compounds retained and can be applied to soils as it is not hot enough to cause any damage to the growing crops before and after planting, but using chemicals to kill it in the water just causes us worse problems further down the food chain or water intakes that are only increasing our already overburdened chemical diets that the EPA and USDA tells us is acceptable when it is not true.The government agencies assigned to protect us have infiltrated by the very corporations that are only interested in profits with little concern to our health or the biosphere.  	31	3
2016-06-04 05:37:28	G. Wayne	I cannot say it often enough as there is no news that is speaking about it. It is as if the news is controlled by the energy companies and the real news is not being reported. Since 04 the methane problem is becoming something that is being overlooked and not reported about. Even though CO2 will remain around almost forever, it is methane that is now becoming more climate influencing as our oceans are reaching saturation and can absorb very little more. Tre so  and acidic that much of the coral left in the shallower waters is being bleached by temperature rise that kills the beings that keep the coral alive. And let us never forget that the nuclear power lobby is just that and can corrupt any body politic with the huge money campaign contributions that few can ignore. Chernobyl and Fukushima Daiichi will never be forgotten and if the winds blew in the other direction towards Tokyo, the story would reported very differently today and still it will be another 35 years before the cleanup is completed if ever.The future for the majority of the people who are getting by is very bleak and in AMerica it is the big lie being told over and over again that nuclear energy is cheap,clean and safe when it is none of that and never has been since it began being used to heat water and threaten nations that do not toe our rhetoric.  is the threat that has endangered us all without any doubt.The voters must awaken and elect Bernie Sanders as he is the best and most experienced politician who is most willing to guide this nation towards the light at the end of the tunnel without bowing to corporate money that has been controlling our path for far too long. We ns must take the responsibility of restoring our democracy by using the only power that we have left and that is "THE POWER OF THE VOTE".  	31	2
2016-06-03 15:42:05	Tinfoil Helmet	@ I've had to come back a few times and read your response again. Well said, sir. Very well said!  	38	5
2016-06-01 06:14:52	G. Wayne	The main reason that few of us ever see or hear about AGW, is that it is reported as unproven and filled with conjecture according to those who want no changes to their bottom lines and desire a continuing of the status quo. Since our majority agriculture commodities are dedicated mostly to Genetically Engineered creations and that has destroyed our seed and food diversities to such a high degree with no quick manner to resolve that dangerous problem especially how badly our courts are corrupted by those same monopolizing seed/food/feed/ag chemical corporations who have spent a hell of a lot of money to corrupt the system in their favor,the new problems are how severely  and the world needs to change many unsustainable lifestyles that have made the problems as severe as tre and how they must alter them to even make a small change in the "CLIMATE" direction with little to show for those changes. Nice sexy and shiny  will be sacrificed to provide healthy food of organic regenerative nature in places that are far from the California growing areas that are so polluted that the groundwater is far from healthy to drink and is killing the workers who are forced to drink it. AGW is what man has caused to happen and now we must admit to it and decide to use our tax monies to develop every renewable energy system as quickly as we can leaving behind unsafe,unclean and uncheap technologies that have been proven as such as NUCLEAR ENERGY. Anyone who thinks nuclear energy is anything good is obviously demented or on the payroll of the industry simply put... Water is for food and rainfall is for green lawns and if it is used for anything that produces no water it should be charged a premium and recovered rather than being dumped into the storm drains to become a part of our water supply system. Changing from our sending it away system to one that recognizes how deadly our water supply system is is still living in the Man Created World that is in love with an imagined world that is far from good for man and his progeny that has been allowed to continue to expand as long as there is enough money for anything they desire with few healthy limitations while everyone else suffers and our EPA,FDA and USDA is politically controlled to give control to those who want all regulations in their favor. Water, HEALTHY WATER is the new realm that is to be dealt with as renewable energies become the NORM in the world and for future societies everywhere. So, finally it is up to us to begin to create this new world with a responsible government and I believe that is where Bernie Sanders/democratic party becomes our governing party versus the "RULING" GOP that takes a backseat as a marginalized and a lot less powerful political party that stands in the way of any meaningful changes to the status quo. If anyone disagrees then tre the part of the problem.  	31	2
2016-05-31 15:13:50	Tinfoil Helmet	The methane that is reaching the surface due to tundra melting in the far north is really going to boost the short term effects of GW. I hate to sound negative but there is  we could capture or slow that process. Our lifestyles need to change drastically, most people do not want to, or understand. Long suburban commutes, huge houses, huge , large yards that only grow grass when food could be growing. This has to end. We can't continue to live this way to spoil ourselves with this material shit we've been convinced that we need, the good times are over. Too many people don't understand, even more are oblivious.  	20	2
2016-05-31 14:49:54	john carlisle	@ that's awesome, all I'm doing is volunteering with up with trees, ride my bike to anywhere that is less than two miles away, and always to work which is 5 mls, and teach an after school program for elementary kids about bike riding. You have got me beat by miles. I know some of the pig farms in North Carolina have been harvesting the methane from pig waste to create electricity since the late 90's. That waste is confined, but how do harness it in lakes? I might have a new project You make a great point about the GOP, but it comes from Democrats as well. That's why I think that challenging the Buckley v Valeo and Citizens United v FEC is of utmost importance for anyone who has a cause, whether environmental or civil...  	1	2
2016-05-31 05:12:36	G. Wayne	I'm trying to make a difference, but with the GOP in Texas it will only be an uphill fight to teach sustainability in ways that will actually achieve any meaningful results with respect to carbon capture. We are beginning with ownia agroforestry and then approaching the aquatic infestation on our lakes with harvesting for gas/electricity production and the additional fertilizer effluent biproducts. These practices keep methane out of the biosphere where it has become the worse of the GHG problem that are causing such ing to the environment as time passes and will reflect badly in the short term of up to 30-40 years.  	20	2
2016-05-31 04:09:11	Tinfoil Helmet	@ sle Well said. I hope I'm still alive to see the generation that wonders "WTF were people thinking? What a bunch of selfish fucking assholes we were."  	38	1
2016-05-31 03:48:48	john carlisle	@ I wasn't trying to attack you, and you're right about the black kettle analogy, thing is is that unless we make changes here,  else will.  Twain once said, " you are never wrong, when you do what's right" Sad thing is is that  is doing what's right. If China see's that we aren't going to change.  GW is saying he doesn't know shit. We have cut funding on renewable energy, and have opened up more drilling in the gulf and arctics irregardless of how low the cost of oil is. Fracking gets more protections, oil and coal gets more subsidies, and solar power gets cut from the grid and tax breaks get knocked out. Why should any nation think that we take anything seriously. Fuck, nuclear proliferation has started all over again. You think global ing concerns these old fucks who are going to die soon anyways, they're in it for the money and the now. Because they will all be dead when the shit hits the fan, and they will never spend all the money that they gain from shitty decisions. If we continue to let low IQ fucks like  think that Romans did more damage to the planet than compiled Industrial evolution and deforestation, he might as well accept flat earth propaganda...  	38	2
2016-05-31 01:29:29	Tinfoil Helmet	@ sle Ah, Okay. We misunderstood each other is all. I was just pointing out the kettle calling the pot black. Blaming the bulk of AGW on China as a scapegoat. As for everything else you've mentioned, I completely understand, and agree with you.  	20	2
2016-05-30 21:59:27	john carlisle	@ because it all play's into the equation when discussing the cycle of greenhouse gases and global ing. I didn't even get into methane. It all plays into why the polar regions are much er than usual causing the north pole which we used to only get to by sled in the summertime, where we can now get there by boat, we are already planning trade routes through the north pole since it's a shorter distance to reach Russia and China. Not to mention Antarctica...  is also being heavily effected. However the real problems won't be felt until around 2050 as predicted in the late 70's, which mostly warned of climate change. Although, other estimates warn of elevated sea levels closer to the end of the century, but we are already being affected by that in Texas, Louisiana, and Florida, Bangladesh is really feeling it as well as some of the lower equitorial isles. However, almost all warn that we are getting towards the point of no return. I personally don't believe in the point of no return, because I remember the 70's quite well, and most major cities skylines could barely be seen due to smog, and it only required a few regulations to turn it around. Same goes for the hole in the ozone and CFC's . However unlike CFC's and emissions, nothing else seems to be changing, and thanks to Citizens United and Buckley v Valeo, the largest contributors have a lot of control over policy.  	31	2

2016-05-30 05:15:49	G. Wayne	I think China was completing a coal-fired power plant every two weeks during 2000-2010. They were shutting down the worst polluting plants later on, but that has not had the desired effect and then set out to develop as much solar and wind power they could afford, but that will not have much effect until they eliminate the coal-fired power plants.We all share the same biosphere even though we cannot see the air pollution that China creates and weather worldwide is effected by the overall carbon created by another.All of the worlds countries must share a burden even if tre beginning an industrial revolution.  	28	2

2016-02-12 02:04:15	john carlisle	@Redbox200​ the Romans couldn't burn enough trees to equal even a quarter of the CO2 produced by , much less the world.

2016-01-19 17:50:44	john carlisle	@ Wochele photosynthesis plays as a factor in the calculations for CO2 factors in global ing via deforestation. Yet even that is just 1 of many factors that scientists use in their models. Even volcanoes play a part, however not all volcanoes have the same type of omissions as the next. Even the neat industry Plays a part, yet this isn't just methane, because I assure you all the methane squeeking out of millions of humans everyday far out way what coming out of cows and pigs etc. Other factors from the meat industry come from shipping and processing, from waste storage etc. Not one scientist believes global ing is not happening, the think tank scientist are only ttying to say that's it's not man made, and out of our control. But we do have alot of facts. Coal and methane are the greatest contributers and are the easiest to replace. But if you don't think coal plays a part concider asking why polar snow lately has become what's called black snow. Knowing the insulating properties of methane why did it take Aliso Canyon so long to become announced as a national emergency? The snows already melting in  in January, our mountains don't have the typical frosty tops... That snow feeds our rivers, things have to change or they will get worse  	31	2

2016-01-18 03:20:06	Mike Wochele	CO2 goes away by the process of photosynthesis within EVERY green plant algae or tree that has ever, or will ever live. It takes CO2 along with sunlight to be converted into simple sugars to help plants grow and reproduce. MOST of the CO2 is converted/ broken down as carbon and oxygen into the cellular makeup of a plant. The oxygen is passed off as a waste gas that we breathe. When that plant dies, and decays, the carbon is then re-stored back into the ground turning into coal and oil after millennia of deep earth pressures and heat. This is a perfect example of what happens to the CO2. When it is burned, the carbon reacts with the oxygen to recombine partially into CO2 again. I imagine you think this bible believing tian failed science and biology 101. Dude, get bent. If this planet doesn't want us on it, it will shake us off like a bad case of fleas.  	20	2
2016-01-18 01:53:00	Dale Husband	+ Wochele It is not a fact unless you can prove it. Where is your data?  	37	5
2016-01-17 19:53:48	Destroyer120296	@ Wochele The thing is yes. A volcano can release more c02 then all that humanity has done. But c02 goes away eventually. It stays for a few hundrd years. Big volcano eruptions happens rarley. So that c02 is broken down and the earth returns to its normal level of c02. But we humans are constantly releasing c02 all the time. Not every few hundred years or thousand year. ALL. THE.TIME. And earht has no time to get rid of the execsive c02 and return to its normal levels. Therfore we are influencing it. ﻿ Then again im gueesing you also belive in god, that the earth is flat and that earth is 6k year old and unchanging? And why would they lie? What are they gaining on lying?  	20	2
2016-01-17 19:18:02	Mike Wochele	+ Explain the FACT that just one 'burp' of one active volcano, can expel over a thousand times the entire amount of CO2 ever, and I mean EVER released by humanity, since we discovered fire. That alone tells me WE, as humanity, couldn't possibly create the climate change/global ing hoax as portrayed by Gore and his ple.  	20	2
2016-01-15 18:33:31	Destroyer120296	+ So you think we humans releasing bilions of tons of c20 is not affecting the earth in the sligthest? That is bullshit. Also we have slowed down our release of c02 whihc might have slowed down the proces for a few years.  	20	2

2015-12-15 17:02:52	Ausborne X	Maybe global ing isn't a bad thing, I mean 1 it will increase the area to farm, 2 we get Antarctica to colonize and it's pushing our science and agriculture to find new technologies.  	15	2
2015-12-29 12:00:30	Ausborne X	+ Poulter scrap the 200 years I just read on the nasa and national geogic's website that it would take around 5,000 years for all the ice to melt  	5	6
2015-12-29 11:54:35	Ausborne X	+ Poulter you do realize it will take well over 200 years for our polar caps to melt right? so in that time, you don't think we'll make any advances in technology to help in agriculture or terraforming?  	31	2
2015-12-29 10:46:19	Martin Poulter	+ So you said "global ing will increase the area to farm" but meant "global ing will decrease the area to farm, but something unrelated that we don't yet know about will increase the area to compensate"?  	14	2
2015-12-17 21:01:00	Ausborne X	@ Poulter By the time Climate change has finally melted our polar caps i feel like we will have found a way to easily terraform deserts. and hey we'll probably colonize mars, or titan which we could send water from earth to them, idk i'm just thinking not trying to argue  	15	6

2017-07-28 19:47:35	Collin Barker	 for those that want a rough interactive map of the world with varyin gea levels, here. Also, Toronto is, at minimum, 80 meters above sea level, while the highest prediction I have seen is 60m. Montreal will mostly be underwater, but Mount Royal will not. Vancouver would be almost completely wiped out as it is on a river delta. This map says it will flodd upto around Cornwall, not even into Lake Ontario and even if that is filled, there is still the Niagara Escarpment and Niagara Falls to jump. Still fairly safe. East coastal towns are toast though  	31	3

2017-04-01 04:58:40	Ba Cleary	global ing exists, but not like they say it does, as if we could stop it when we actually can't, its a natural occurrence anyway, and it's not like burning fossil fuels are the sole reason, with or without that it was happening long before we even had  or knew about oil, take a look at ancient cities lost underwater, did that happen because burned coal 1000s of years ago? I highly doubt it, yet governments knowing about under water cities and still stupid enough to continue to develop along coast lines, Antarctica used to have vegetation on it, so it wasn't always frozen, we are just ending out the ice age obviously, ice age in meaning there is still ice glaciers left to melt.  	31	2

It's all anxious rhetoric.  americans-really-move-to-ca-a-reality-check/ EVERY election people always threaten to move to  but it never comes through. It's much harder than ns think to immigrate to . Roughly 800,000 Canadians immigrate to the US every year. About 8-10 thousands ns immigrate to  every year.   The immigration rate from  to the US is massively higher, and that won't and can't change anytime soon, the difference is to large to even call plausible. "Derr what "ian" wants to immigrate "of" ."

2016-10-27 02:16:03	Overwelmdn underated	It varies a lot, it's a huge continent. The lower elevation areas like the praries and some of southwestern ontario will be affected, and every province has some area that is low lying. BC is very high elevation and has the Canadian Shield on the coast. Northern Ontario is quite high, I believe. But it isn't the rise in seawater that poses the real threat. It's the superstorms PLUS the higher sea level. And as the climate s, you can get more tornados and extreme weather in places that are usually too cold for that. Which is why you are seeing more crazy storms and tornados in Ontario and parts of the Northern United States. We don't just need to shore up the cost with levees (or some equivalent solution, including resettling) - we will need better advanced warning systems and buildings that are resistant to extreme weather events. And not just terrestrial events. A very large CME could cause an irreversible blackout that destroys all electronics, unless we devise shielding for them. Not to mention, all the factories that MAKE those electronics would be wiped out. We don't have systematic redundancy. We need more than continuity of government in Cheyenne Mountain. If I were president, I'd be taking action on this immediately. We barely dodged a very large coronal mass ejection in 2012 and every year is playing russian roulette with the sun. By 2040 we need to be in giant domes, or at least to become partially subterranean, to avoid climate and -borne extreme weather events. At some point, we are going to need to reverse the heating of the planet through geoengineering, since the hydrocarbons we are pumping out are terraforming the planet, and now that process has crossed a tipping point at which it becomes a positive feedback loop. On , that loop heat the surface to something like 230 degrees Celcius (I can't recall the exact number, but skin-meltingly hot). You can actually build systems to prevent these catastrophies pretty easily, with advances in  colonization and better computer modeling of the sun and climate. Because the systems are complex, tre difficult to predict, but our understanding of those systems is improving. So let's say, we predict an 80% chance a solar flare is going to launch charged particles directly at the earth. What are some ways we can prepare? We could retrofit all our technology with some kind of metamaterial coating. We could also deploy a gigantic " shield" that reflects or redirects those charged particles, and can be deployed and repositioned quickly. Ideally, you could build such a device in the vacuum of , and in a lot of ways that is the simpler solution, but is in itself an engineering challenge. But  manufacturing holds some advantages, like ability to cold weld objects together, the ability to harvest building materials from  itself, through asteroid mining. Or let's say you made it of some kind of gene reflector, so carbon, you can use a  elevator to supply the feedstock from reduced plant material on earth, and because the gene is atomically thin, you can make very large surface area with very little material, but someone smarter than I would have to calculate something like that. Anyway, my point is that we are not good at measuring risk at all. There is all this talk of ISIS as being an immediate threat, but climate is a greater threat by far, and here's what's wrong with our thinking. There are what I consider three very important variables to consider when measuring risk. So you want to have these as accurately measured as possible before you make a decision on whether to act on the risk-level to avoid a consequence. One, what are the odds that a negative outcome will occur? Two, what is the spectrum of best to worst case scenarios, and what are their respective probabilities of occuring? Three, what is the *magnitude* of the consequence. So risk is not just evaluating the probability of an event, but quantifying where possible the damage of catastrophic outcomes. So for example, you are more likely to be killed by a fridge than by an asteroid. But which is more important to prepare for, as a society? The outcome of fridge worst case scenario is death, and even deaths of thousands from this cause. But the worst case scenario of an asteroid (even though the chances are FAR LESS of it happening) are cataclysmic. The destruction of civilization and all humanity. Our governments NEED TO START MAKING THESE RISK CALCULATIONS IN A FORMAL WAY. These politicians have no idea what tre doing.. tre mostly trained lawyers (liars). That is their tradecraft, not logic, but the arrangement of s to manipulate favourable *perception.* In a country where the philosophy of Ayn Rand is Personal Happiness + Rational Self Interest = Ultimate . So as long as believing something makes you happy, you have just proven it's OBJECTIVELY TRUE by definition. In fact, Randian objectivism is a paradox of a self-proving ideology. It is fundamentally similar to theocracy. In , your own subjective experience is God. Which is why the policies are so fucking retarded, because even the Democratics are total acolytes of n Exceptionalism (the consequence of  Shrugged and  Greenspan). Which is how you can incinerate innocent women and children overseas, while also calling for "human decency." This characteristic makes  technically a fundamentalist state, and I would go so far as to call it a neo-puritanical theocracy. Since Puritanism was proto n Exceptionalism, and you can find very good examples in primary documents like On Plymouth Plantation for the "city on a hilltop" philosophy. As such, subjectivism masquerading as universal objectivism has completely destroyed almost every important institution in the US, from the control of currency to fundamental human rights like privacy, free speech, freedom of mobility, habeus corpus, and this list goes on and on. All the corruption stems from a fractal of that one single lie, a truly amazing fact of modern society that few are aware of. Until  accepts that facts are simply facts, and are inarguable, and devises a system to DEFINITELY PROVE THE FACTS and establish a dialogue of common truth, it is doomed to inaction, paralyzed by the two party system designed to break up citizen power and yet consolidate state power (like Loius XIV). You need to replace every one of those moronic lawyers in congress with engineers and scientists who are actually driven by imagination and a passion for truth to solve the world's problems.  	31	2

2016-05-23 07:15:48	WaterspoutsOfTheDeep	+ ander you left out the whole prairies. There would be a huge amount of habitable land. If the world is  enough for all of the ice to melt then that would also make the norther territories far more habitable too. Also it is the 21st century the lakes aren't an issue and are in fact a boon because of all the fresh water. 's land is largely rocky it isn't all coastline where it is a nightmare for foundations. So that is a HUGE boon too for building.  also has some of the largest deposits of uranium in the world and oil which can easily fuel large industrial metroplexes if they wanted with no shortage of fresh water. So energy, water, land, and moderate climate since it is farther north it would be much nicer if the earth got er and a hot hell just further south in the USA.  is also a fairly dependable country given it's size even and topogy. Which would be important given the possible instability in that time period.  	31	6
2016-05-23 07:08:01	WaterspoutsOfTheDeep	+ Ultor The majority of the polar ice cap melts and is gone in the summer now already. I think the majority of the water will come from the antarctic ice cap melting.  	5	6

2016-05-09 01:30:43	Overwelmdn underated	@ ander Yeah but any water I see is sitting atop the landmass in lakes. Our population density is 3 per square mile, one of the lowest of all nations on earth. Moreover, the landmass in total is the third largest on earth, at 3.5 million square miles, exceeded only by Russia and Antarctica. So  is the total opposite of your argument! Partly because of the topology, like the Canadian Shield. Low elevation places may be overtaken.. but the majority of the landmass, at higher altitudes, will remain unaffected.. if anything, the temperate climate will benefit Canadian ecology. I read a study out of NASA making climatological projections and put Toronto area as a topical climate in 90 years or so. Although it would be terrible, the global consequences would likely send a large-scale exodus of refugees into . In the long-term,  would probably prosper. It's sad to say, but may in fact be true. That is not considering, however, the increase in the power and frequency of superstorms, which is a consequence of climate change.. but our infrastructure is already vulnerable to a number of catastrophic possiblities, and Fort McMurray is just one example. Our government, not unlike the US, have languished in comfortable corruption. Meanwhile, disaster looms. Because we find ourselves too lazy or stupid to be adequately prepared for the consequences of our own actions.. I only hope we can come up with ideas to fix, or at least survive, what we have done to the planet.  	31	2

2015-11-28 21:29:56	Derek Gibson	This only shows ocean level along the coast. It doesn't show the effects of increased rain and clouds due to more water surface area. I think many of the deserts that used to be lakes or oceans would be again. Some are very close to sea level already. Most if not all of the land would be green. I also think that much further in the future the rain increase would push more land into the ocean and make the water rise even more until eventually its all a swamp with the exception of volcanos.  	31	3

2015-12-03 13:53:30	Leo	@ Yeah, of course it's not that fast. Still, good luck trying to find a nice spot to fit all the things that have to be moved from the coastal regions around the world in the next 50 years so that your little world remains unchanged. Since almost half of the world's population live up to 60 km from the coast, that might be somewhat painstaking.  	14	3
2015-12-03 03:54:45	oldnotweak	@Leopoldo Aranha maybe that would happen... IF ALL THE ICE MELTED AT ONCE and that isnt happening even in the worst case scenario imagined... other than in ridiculous movies  	5	6
2015-12-03 01:23:07	Leo	@ Well, having major hub servers and tech parks underwater would certainly not do good things to poor ol' internet as we know. And, as an addendum, all major rocket launch sites will be underwater, too, with the major exception being Baikonur (dem russians...), so, yeah, not just the internet, but communication in general will go down and, with it, our whole modern financial system, which will bring corporations to their knees. Yeah, those corporations like Google, Microsoft, etc. We will be set basically 150 years back in technological terms when it comes to communication and finances. That is to say, if those damn teleg cables would still work. If not, we would be even further back.  	31	3

2016-01-21 23:24:34	Martin Poulter	@ Epicness Ice is actually less dense than water. If it were more dense than water, it wouldn't float. It's Archimedes' Principle.  	33	6
2016-01-21 23:13:05	Platinum Epicness	+ Ice is just a solid, condensed version of water. When ice is formed, the water molecules huddle together and become solid, because tre tightly packed. I think to think of it this way: When water molecules get too cold, they huddle together for th, then they become so densely packed, they turn into a solid. Its kinda opposite for evaporation: water molecules get too hot, so they  themselves from others to cool off. Of course, there isn't actually a temperature change, but that's just how I think of it.  	33	6
2015-12-30 09:00:37	Martin Poulter	@ No direct effect, but ice is very good at reflecting sunlight back into  and ocean is very good at absorbing sunlight, so a melted Arctic would lead to more absorption, hence more thermal expansion.  	5	6
2015-12-30 00:39:40	Charlie Crome	+ Poulter yeah. the Arctic melting would have literally no effect on the sea levels.  	5	6
2015-12-24 11:14:53	Martin Poulter	@ The ice on  and Antarctica isn't in the water, no.  	5	6
2015-12-20 16:05:39	Peter Peterson	Most of the world's ice is sits on top of land in the form of glaciers so if it melted it would run into the ocean raising the sea level  	5	6
2015-12-17 19:46:39	Martin Poulter	+ Even if it snowed occasionally, the snow would not be enough to replace kilometers-thick ts of ice.  	5	6

2015-11-24 09:01:49	lachlan anders-macLeod	+ that would be the case if the ice was in the water already but the ice is actually on land in the form of glaciers on greenland and antartica, when that melts then the water will flow into the ocean.  	5	6

Anyway, So this has been proven before, why do you think ice ages has happened before? It couldn't be as random as we think, can it? So back then there must've been something causing high climates, the Earth enters an ice age, things cool down and bada bing bada bang, everything back to normal... except for humans xD  	31	6

2015-10-11 11:48:08	Sam Spade	Filling desert basins with ocean water with the goal of lowering rising ocean levels and reversing global ing may work because the presence of these inland seas would help lower temperatures in some of the hottest places on earth. If lake Eyre in  were filled with ocean water from the Coral Sea, hydro electric power could be produced from the water’s journey into the lake and out to the  Sea, and  would have an inland sea larger than . The Gobi desert and western China have about five huge depressions which could be filled with ocean water and connected to each other by canals streaching from China’s east coast to the Aral and Caspian Seas. The pressence of these seas would eliminate dust storms and lessen the severity of droughts in central Asia and in Northern China. Filling Africa’s  depression with water from the Atlantic would dramatically lower local temperatues, increase rainfall, and provide a huge fishery for local people. -These thoughts of mine are all dreams of coarse. But, some dreams become reality. If global ing is real, -if oceans are steadilly rising, we must attempt to reverse the proccess. To stand by and allow Holland, Bangladesh, London, Beijing, New York, Singapore, Lagos, and Rio to be flooded without attempting to do what I have proposed seems unwise. Filling the world’s desert basins with water may buy us the time we need to transition from coal and petrolium to cleaner and more sustainable energy sources (thorium reactors, algeatech, energy towers, tidal power, ect..).  	31	3

2015-10-06 17:44:20	Deksam101	This looks like an al gore prediction at best, that wont happen. Fact is, water expands when it is ice, when it melts it would take up less , the tall ice pushed up out of the water is the expansion of that water. So the melted level would be about the same. What little ice melting on land would be a minor rise, IF the world was getting ing it would be a natural cycle that has been doing it for millions of years. Also the world has changed it's shape naturally thousands of times, but now that we are here, it is not allowed to change anymore? Throwing tons of money at it wont change anything noticeable, except fatten the pockets of people like al gore. Our job is to roll with the changes not to roll against it.  	31	6

2019-07-10 14:42:37	Warcry Player	México City was built on a large lake, it is literally floating on a huge lake (Tenochtitlan architecture) Hernán Cortés was shocked when he came here because it was a big city, right now there are a Lot of places with Spain, ch, Modern architecture it's a city with a long history (come on, three block from my house it's old Trosky house) you can't just say it was Spain city, Aztec city etc because every single culture has left its . Although even if México city survive the flood the earth still be missing the two poles that control the weather, there won't be chance to anybody (i Guess) even if you survive. So we have to take care of the earth we're still on time.  	24	3

However, the fact that they decided to develop inland cities instead of moving to shores (like most nations in the world do pretty much anywhere from s to Asia), that's indeed smart if we're talking possible floods.  	1	3

You, young lady, are afraid for no reason. Heat , such a mild difference would have no effect on life, do you think it going to be 120degrees world wide,?? Your own Doom Sayers say 1-2 degree increase, no biggie. We , and our ability to cull our own numbers through war and murder should worry you more, because war is coming  	31	2
2015-10-31 11:02:07	Kattenelvis	@ Yeah lets look at the current migration from the middle east to Europe and Mexico to USA, theres allot of turmoil and the same thing but on a larger scale wouldbe bad. It would get hotter, not more hummidity and the more waterways rrquires construction of new ports which would take resources and money. And allot of people cant move inland, its not only america, If you look at china and india you will see that 1 bilion people will be forced to move, and that is an insane level.  	1	1
2015-10-30 14:39:56	proteus371	+katten elvis -- with all the rain , fresh water would be more plentiful, the heat is only expected to go up 2degrees Celsius in the next 100yrs, so I don't think that would be a problem, and inland homes will be more valuable, so as the rich relocate the would be a nice money exchange. Do you think this would happen overnight?? it would, if it was real, be a very slow transition over decades ! Look at the map, over 90% of the world population is 25 miles from the coast, they would just move. 50 % of USA population live in 5% of landmass, we have the room. Higher humidity, more rain and longer growing seasons mean more food. More waterways means cheaper transportation and more power sources. Relocation would mean more building and more jobsYou have let these politicians scare you while they reap the money from the $1.2 billion Global Warming scare, I will not argue it's validity, but I will it's result. Don't worry young girl, you will be fine.  	31	3
2015-10-29 22:04:31	Kattenelvis	+ .____. no big deal?!?!? Refuges from all over the world will be running towards inner land, most ecnomic centres and large population centers are on the coasts, so the world economy would crash. World trade would stagnate and the heat + lack of fresh water will lead to a food cricys, and this will make countries having to focus less on science which would lead to dieses and famine all over the world.  	3	1

It is only in Man's self centeredness of thinking, that we assume that this is a new thing. The fact still stands that the primary heating source of our planet is still the sun. Did anyone stop to realize that Mar's ice caps grow and shrink at the same rate our does? Food for thought.  	20	2

2015-09-10 07:01:17	Jerry C	This is pure fantasy. Even if we used up all of the oil, coal and natural gas on the planet, it would NOT get hot enough to melt the Antarctic ice ts because it doesn't get  enough in Antarctica to melt ice. In fact it's so cold there for most of the year that propane can be poured from a propane tank into a regular gas can without any of it changing to a gas. At such temperatures, it's not possible for water ice to melt, so your doomsday scenario just will not ever happen.  	5	6

2015-09-13 19:24:40	Jerry C	@ The solution is there for us to use. The only reason we don't move forward with it is that 80,000 coal miners and 2 million oil industry workers would lose their jobs when the switch away from fossil fuels was complete.  	3	2

2015-09-13 17:52:49	Jerry C	@ When in the past did Antarctica melt completely? The only time that I am aware of was when it was located farther north. I think its just a matter of research with fusion power plants. For commercial power production tre probably 50 years in the future. Which would be about perfect because power demands will be much higher at that point and it would make sense to replace the old LFTRs with new fusion power plants.  	5	6
2015-09-13 17:01:19	Armoured Challenger	@ C It certainly was able to melt polar ice caps in the past when other effects initiated positive feedback, so I see no reason why it shouldn't melt again with the same temperatures. LFTR is a good idea. The concept is not new, molten salt reactors (MSR) were tested in the cold war but research was cut back largely because it didn't create bomb material. It would be a great replacement for coal/oil/uranium based powerplants, atleast until, or if, nuclear fusion is controlled in such a manner that energy can be extracted.  	5	6
2015-09-13 13:41:27	Jerry C	@ While that is true, the ing caused by that feedback would not be enough to overcome the temperatures found in Antarctica for the majority of the year. Don't get me wrong, I am all for changing the way we do things. I think the world as a whole needs to switch from coal, natural gas and existing uranium based nuclear power generation to Liquid Fluoride ium Reactors (LFTR) I think we should build the extra LFTR's needed to produce carbon neutral fuels for our transportation systems. It would be easy enough to make dimethyl ether and methanol using hydrogen and CO2 harvested from the atmosphere and with the power produced by a couple dozen LFTRs you can make a lot of hydrogen and capture a lot of CO2 from the atmosphere. Yes, LFTRs do generate  waste, but that waste is in the form of plutonium 238 which cannot, by itself, be used to make nuclear weapons. The amount of plutonium 238 generated is equal to about 1% of the amount of nuclear waste created by the average uranium based nuclear reactor. Plus every  agency on the planet is desperate to get their hands on any plutonium 238 they can, because they use it in the radioisotope thermoelectric generators that power their deep  probes and planetary rovers. There is enough thorium stored in barrels in the ground right now to power the planet for the next 500-1000 years. Also thorium is way more abundant than uranium, it's easier to find and easier to extract than uranium. One of the greatest advantages is that LFTRs are 100% safe, they cannot melt down because everything inside the reactor is already liquid, and they do not use water for cooling, so there is no chance of a hydrogen explosion. When a LFTR loses power, that's it, its off. What happens without power? The frozen salt plug that keeps the fuel in the reactor melts and the contents of the reactor drain into a container designed to rapidly remove heat from the contents, much like the heatsink on a CPU. Another major benefit of switching to LFTRs for power generation is that each LFTR can use the plant waste heat to desalinate million of gallons of seawater every day. This would end the stress of groundwater extraction on the environment as well as end the massive drain from rivers. Heck deserts like Kuwait, Iraq, Yemen, Oman, Egypt, Israel and so many others could turn their countries green because they would have more than enough water to make the deserts bloom. Plus turning the deserts green would go a long way towards removing the 100+ PPM of CO2 that we have added to the atmosphere since 1900. Check out any of the dozens of videos of Kirk Sorensen talking about this very subject. He does a much better job of explaining this than I ever could.  	31	2
2015-09-12 12:05:50	Armoured Challenger	+ C There is such a thing called positive feedback. Temperature rise (for example caused by extra CO2) creates a change on the planet and that change creates even stronger ing. A lot of methane is trapped in permafrost, if it melts the gas releases, methane is a lot stronger greenhouse gas than CO2. Melting sea ice reveals darker water under it and ing becomes stronger. Oceans ability to store CO2 falls when it's temperature rises so even more extra CO2 comes into atmosphere from oceans. You get the basic idea.  	31	2

2015-09-10 03:00:21	2000toinfinity	The Arctic Ocean was once 72 degrees, and Antarctica once had lush green forests instead of an ice cap. There has been more and less ice than there is now, numerous times in the past. There are plenty of cities worldwide that have long since been covered by a few hundred feet of ocean water or more. It's part of the Earth's natural cycles. Call it global ing, global cooling, climate change, it's been happening for over a billion years. Man's industrial age hasn't been around long enough to alter it yet. Any claims that the Earth is ing at an accelerated rate, are totally unscientific and foolish. Accurate readings, all over the Earth haven't been taken for a long enough period of time to even make that claim.  	31	2
2019-04-29 04:09:35	Kelli Fisher	@ There are natural cycles and then there are accelerated cycles due increased factors acting upon the natural cycle. So the amplitude of the cycle from an outside source is what we are dealing with. Gas makes a fire hotter as does more oxygen...so it stands to logic that as more factors are added in...the more a quickening happens. Because our industrial age brought in the use of fossil fuels, factory farming ( methane gas increases), deforestation and a depletion of our ozone layer plus the loss of the polar ice as a reflecting mirror from radiation from the sun, the temps in the oceans are changing the currents which drive weather too which adds up to more loss of ice plus the radical storms we are seeing now. So the cycle you are clinging to dearly probably wouldn't be happening as fast as it is now. It's basic physics 101 coupled with Chemistry 101. Can't beat science.  	31	2

2015-11-19 22:07:57	2000toinfinity	@Sabel Tann​ the impact of the industrial age on climate isn't provable, as there were no accurate, and broad global examinations of climate prior to the middle of the 20th Century. ﻿Warmist are making a very unscientific assumption with no data to back it up from pre Industrial Age times. The pollution of the Industrial Age is undeniable. Broad and Accurate World climate data just doesnt exist pre Industrial age though.  	20	2
2015-11-19 17:31:00	Christian	That's true, it's the same with CO2 emissions. However there is no doubt reducing CO2 emission would better the enviroment and air quality. Look at LA before 1970 and catalytic converters the place was toxic and almost exclusively caused by . Of course that was just on a local scale, however today there are a lot of 3rd world cities much more polluted than LA ever was this of course must have an global impact.  	20	2

We put man in , there are over 2 BILLION  on the earth, 8 Billion humans, per year estimated 22 billion chickens and 8 billion other farting farm animals, not to mention the worst of all is the ships going over the great ocean.

2015-09-12 15:46:37	2000toinfinity	In 1880 you didn't have the worldwide network of, thousands of measuring points like you do now. That you still clutch and argue that point is laughable. The only benefit of back then is that you didn't have people motivated by political bullshit doctoring data, like you do now. You can't acknowledge the massive effect of the Sun's solar cycle, and be a global ist. It contradicts what you are trying to do politically. There are studies showing the CO2 hypothesis is bullshit as well. Let's just continue ignoring them. Looking at the atmosphere's total volume, and percentages of each thing in it. Man's emissions are smaller than minuscule. You can't observe natural climate fluctuation for such a short period of time, and blame the industrial age. If this was back in the 1880s people like you would be able to get away with it. But there is too much free scientific information available now days, for such foolishness. Yeah, no more snow in the winter like Al Gore said. We have cool summers repeatedly, but ist make the excuse, oh, but the Earth as a whole got er, even though it didn't. Warmist say, there will no longer be ice at the north and south pole. Laughable. No satellite imagery, naval imagery, etc. backs up those lies. Hey the polar bears will die out. Ummm, no. The Polar Bear population is bigger now then it has been in a while. But people like you don't care. You have an agenda.  	20	2
2015-09-12 14:12:06	Armoured Challenger	@ It was implied. We have pretty good idea what has happened past 500 million years. By 1880 I mean worldwide coverage. Instruments weren't primitive, reliable thermomethers were produced centuries earlier in 16th and 17th century. "Earth is several billion years old/.../grand scheme" Climate changes whatever forces it to change at the time. So unless there is after- effect of some variable, what happened in history is irrevalent. For example. Earth was a hothouse 50 million years ago. Does it matter? No, because the historical conditions don't matter (in this topic), only the mechanisms that created or held that condition matter. It's the play of variables. Those variables (CO2 level, sun's activity...) change in strengh. Unless the balance, of the effect of the variables, shifts, climate doesn't change. "fraction of a fraction" The effect of something does not correlate with the proportions/size of it. For example, the infrared absorbtion rates of CO2 methane and water vapor are made sure by experimentation. Our understanding of climate sensitivity is getting more accurate over time.  	31	2
2015-09-12 13:45:34	2000toinfinity	, "your logic that therefore man can not affect the climate is false." No where in my comment did I say that. It is scientific fact that climate changes as Earth goes through natural cycles. As far as how fast or slow the natural cycles change climate, we can't say for sure as we don't have accurate records over the last billion years. We have general ball park numbers. You stated "Direct records have been taken from 1880" By who? In 1880 maybe a few places here and there, had intelligent men taking temperature readings with their primitive instruments, but accurate meteorological, and climate records, taken from enough locations in the world to even try and make a suggestion of a climate pattern didn't happen until well into the 20th Century, that is a fact. To suggest that accurate records have been taken since 1880 is comical, and something you say in conversations with people ignorant of the topic. Furthermore, the Earth is several billion years old. The Earth's atmosphere is huge in volume. It is totally ic to take the fraction of a fraction of a fraction of a fraction of a snapshot from the Industrial Age, which doesn't even show up on the grand timescale of Earth's history, because the time frame is too small, and say yup, it's conclusive, man is causing the Earth to Warm. You would need several thousand years of observations, and data collection, to even make a valid scientific argument either way.  	20	2
2015-09-12 12:22:16	Armoured Challenger	+ You know that it has been happening but your logic that therefore man can not affect the climate is false. You blame natural cycles but you have no idea what natural cycles are doing now. You don't know how fast tre to change the climate. Direct records have been taken from 1880, it's enough to conclude that man is changing the climate. Climate reacts to whatever forces it to change at the time.  	20	2

He's not part of a conspiracy to do anything. And yeah, sometimes the Koch brothers support Democrats, but the vast majority of the time they support Republicans and tre certainly conservative. Have you ever heard the stories of them trying to coerce their employees to vote Republicans? They're political slime, and they have no interest in helping  and more interest in fooling people like you to their own ends...  	20	2
2015-12-18 18:47:40	bza069	+ Nguyen you believe Al Gore and call me stupid? haha.... Btw, Koch brothers donate to BOTH parties! fact. Many elites support both sides so that politicians are beholden to their largest contributors regardless of election results. also banks and other crony capitalists often contribute to both sides as well. its a game to them & incrementally wrestling away your freedom and tax money is the objective  	7	2
2015-12-18 18:41:13	bza069	+ Nguyen agree that vast populations inhabit coast lines who would be subject to flooding, IF major melt off occur. but its just another generated crisis to get gullible people paranoid enough to beg that governments protect them "at any cost". dont forget most of the "proof" comes from the governments' salaried pseudo-scientists...whats the chance of lying politicians to manipulate data for their own benefit?  	31	3
2015-12-18 17:47:33	Brian Nguyen	+ Maybe you should realize that you're being defrauded by those rich oil dudes like the Koch brothers with money, who have every interest in hiding global ing so they can continue to sell their petroleum and fossil fuels. I don't think you pay attention, so let me tell you that oil companies always pay the vast majority of their campaign donations to Republicans - it's no coincidence that party is filled with global ing deniers. But whatever - be a p, randomly blame Al Gore if you want. I alone can't save you from your own stupidity.  	20	2
2015-12-18 17:43:55	Brian Nguyen	+ Yawn... Are you sure? Last time I checked, the ocean isn't a half- empty bucket which can be filled up before overflowing... If you didn't notice, most of the world's coastal settlements are at sea level, so even a seemingly minor sea level rise of a few feet could be destructive, and melting glaciers during the Ice Age completely changed the Earth's topogy... You're an ignorant fool if you really believe that the melting of the ic and Antarctic ice ts would do nothing or that there's not enough ice in the world to do anything... But hey, why should I care about what you babble? 99% of the world's climatologists and the global leaders working with the Kyoto Protocol aren't going to stop to abet your idocy.  	31	6

2015-12-18 02:31:46	Brian Nguyen	@ Lastly though, you are probably seriously underestimating the amount of ice on Earth - for one thing, Antarctica's ice t is two kilometers deep - very high. It's extremely ridiculous of you to think you can actually assume the nature of our world just by looking at globe instead of using actual science and statistics.  	5	6
2015-12-18 02:24:43	Brian Nguyen	+ If you don't believe me, look at history. Melting glaciers during the Ice Age flooded the n-Siberian and Australasian landbridges, filled the Mediterranean Sea, created the Strait of Bosprous, and formed the English Channel. Now, we're talking about far less ice, but the change would still be very significant considering how massive the previous changes were.  	5	6
2015-12-18 02:22:24	Brian Nguyen	+ Impossibly high? Not really... The world's oceans on average are fourteen thousand feet deep, and that contains 96 percent of the world's water. The world's frozen water meanwhile accounts for about 90 percent of the remainder of the world's water, and then even the majority of that is in the world's polar ice caps. So, here we're talking about three percent of the world's water enclosed in polar ice caps. If 96 percent of the world's water can create oceans 14,000 feet deep, imagine what would happen if you added the melted remains of all the world's polar ice caps; even though three percent of the world's water may seem small on paper, it would be a massive change since this three percent represents about three ninety-sixths the volume of the already extremely gigantic ocean; anywhere at or below sea level would certainly be flooded.  	31	6
2015-12-18 00:31:01	bza069	+ Poulter on a globe, if tre accurate, the polar caps would need to be impossibly high to contain enough ice to significantly raise sea levels that cover 70% of surface area.  	5	6

2015-09-10 12:46:50	Brian Nguyen	+ I find your comment absolutely ridiculous... You don't have any real statistics to state that, and also polar ice makes up 2% of the world's water. Of course melting ice would affect world sea levels, and threaten low-lying coastal areas.  	5	6

2015-09-06 19:25:46	Mazra	The temperature has risen half a degree Celsius. The average temperature on Antarctica is like -37 degrees Celsius. It's not like there's be a 216-feet flood. It might rise 7-10 meters, but that's about it. And that would be over a period of something like 100 years.  	5	6
2015-09-12 12:08:36	Armoured Challenger	+Qaoz Actually the rise in about 100 years would be 0.8-2 meters (in the end of 21st entury). However, it begins to rise faster and faster.  	3	1

An overly dramatic exaggeration? Look at the anomaly map - notice the unusually cold water all around Antarctica and south of  - notice how abnormally  the oceans are - even with all that glacial melt flowing:  I packed and left  - and moved up the mountain 2,500 feet with easy access to 4,000 feet. Those who are aware of the mass animal deaths that's underway will realize a worldwide famine is coming... atmospheric methane, radiation poisoning, military violence... the biggest threats to survival are in the northern hemisphere. The southern hemisphere has its own air circulation system and is relatively protected from the radiation in the ocean by the equatorial bulge - 11 miles high, 2,000 miles wide, 5 miles deep and 24,000 miles around...  	31	3
2015-12-29 08:51:20	Max P	The ocean having more surface area would heat the planet causing larger and more intense weather around the world.

2015-08-24 16:03:48	Mahande3	I'm glad to see that the Business Insider has even been effected by this global ing scare. This video has no basis in reality as none of the studies done about sea level rise have ever taken into account the density of ice (0.9) or done an even dispersal of that ice along the entire surface of the ocean to find the actual sea level rise. Add to that glaring omission that it would take a rise of 10 degrees C in order to fully melt all of the ice in the world and you have a video with no basis in reality whatsoever. Congratulations.  	31	6

But when the icecaps will melt (ice) (in water) this much of the world will be underwater. OK Science battling Science, which will win, the principle that has been in place for two thousand years, or the hoax that is Global Warming (YAWN)  	5	6

As it is though, humans are too inept to think logically or efficiently, therefore I no longer care what happens to them.      Humans are a scourge. The icecaps melting would still not bring the global population down to what it should be.      What really needs to happen is for the powers that be to unleash the disease they have to bring our population down by at least 50%. Note at least 50%.  	31	2

2015-07-01 04:34:41	Hipster Michael Myers	@ (TL;DR BELOW) Well, this was all definitely before production and pollution came into play. Back then, there were only farms and villages, and maybe some castles, I'm not too sure, I don't think we had much of it during the recorded times. We're dating back to where calendars never existed. Far far back from the Roman Empire. When the Earth's population was lower than 1 billion. Think of all the factories that we have now. Think of all the Nuclear reactors we have that are in close proximity in the rising seas. It's not going to be exactly all peachy keen, it's not gonna just be water shows up, and now cities are useless. There's always a catch. When the water comes in, EVERYTHING is going to be mixed in it. Nuclear waste, debris, resources, oils, suntan lotion, everything harmful to the sea is going to be in it, and it's going to cause a worldwide oceanic pollution crisis, and it' happening EVERYWHERE. TL;DR Pollution, and all the shit in the cities are gonna mix in the water, and spread everywhere. Pretty .  	31	2

2015-05-26 15:28:52	sandpebbles	Ever measure the level of water in a glass of ice water.When the ice melts the level does not change. That is because the water displacement has already occurred. This model is inaccurate. All those ice shelf's that extend into the oceans and s would not affect the sea levels. People need to start critically thinking and not buy into the religion of global ing, ah sorry ,now climate change. Record cold, snows last two winters.Think for your self.  	5	6

2015-05-24 01:56:25	Cyrus the Acceptable	This is likely to be a gradual thing. The sea level rises approximately 3mm every year. So... you have plenty of time to move out of these danger-areas. The question is: will you? Based on this information?      Also, I don't see **all** the ice melting by the end of the century. A lot of factors go into climate change. Anthropogenic activity like people burning fossil fuels is only a small cause amongst larger ones, like **the fucking Sun**.      There's plenty we can do to reduce how we negatively affect our environment, but there is only so much we, as a whole, can do with today's affordable technologies. So stop freaking out about some kind of contrived impending doom we somehow solely bring upon ourselves.      Do your own part and set an example for others. Let's do the best we can as we responsibly move into the mid-21st/22nd century on this beautiful planet.  	31	2

2015-04-23 19:36:45	Ray Araya	The melting of ice at the earth poles will not only increase the sea level, it will also shift the earth axis of rotation. This is because the earth spins, that's why most of the water will go to the earth equator. The earth equator diameter is bigger the polar diameter. A simple forces analysis will prove that earth will shift its axis of rotation if more ice will melt at the earth poles.  	5	6
2015-04-28 20:54:05	Ray Araya	The earth will shift its axis of rotation if more ice will melt at the earth poles, so this will Not be what the earth will look like.  	5	6

2015-04-23 19:37:16	Ray Araya	There are many evidences that the earth had shifted its axis of rotation before. One is the zebra stripes under the bottom of the ocean, the magnetic striping on the ocean floor, or the magnetic orientation of the rock. These zebra stripes was because the earth magnetic poles had shifted almost regularly. Base on the things we know about magnets, the only possible reason why the earth magnetic poles shifted, is because the earth molten metal core shifted. These shifting of earth molten metal core, the only possible trigger is the shifting of earth axis of rotation. And because its almost regularly and more frequent, the most possible trigger is the regular and more frequent melting of the ice at the earth poles and its freezing.... 2nd evidence that earth had shifted its earth axis of rotation are the cracks on earth crust, the fault lines, the line separating the tectonic plates. Earth equatorial diameter is bigger than its polar diameter because earth spin. The shifting of earth axis of rotation, or the time the earth poles become the earth equator, it reshape the earth. The shrinking and the expanding of the earth crust during the poles shift is the only possible reason why the earth crust cracks. 3rd evidence that the earth shifted its axis of rotation before is the fossil fuels that we are getting near the earth poles. Sample, Alaska's oil and coals. Coals from a tropical forest before and oil from the animal fats, animals that can only survive in a tropical climate. 4th evidence is the existence of the Piri Reis map. A pre modern map showing coast lines that are covered with ice. The existence of this Piri Reis map, the pyramids, Puma Punku stones, the evidences that the ancient alien supporters are getting, are more likely the evidence of the existence of ancient civilizations present before the shifting of the earth axis of rotation.... The map of the earth before it shift its axis of rotation, is a treasure map. Using our tendencies, civilizations are more concentrated near the shore lines..  	31	2

2015-06-26 07:45:22	snidelywhiplash	@Tancri Von Bouzin It's thought that such a huge inflow of fresh water into the ocean would reduce the salt content of the water enough to disrupt thermohaline currents, possibly throwing Northern Europe (among other places) into a *very* cold period. Possibly another ice age.  	5	6

2015-05-22 17:25:32	The One Guy	@Tancri Von Bouzin True, the effects of shifting wind/ocean currents, along with desertification would changed the climates of many of these places. Areas like Siberia and  would become more temperate while more equatorial areas would suffer heavily from desertification. Here is an example of the US if models come true   	36	2
2015-04-28 21:06:07	j clendinen	@Tancri Von Bouzin Yes, and they have such large mass that it would take a long time to melt. Think of an ice cube vs a large block of ice: the latter takes longer to melt because it has a different heat capacity. Now think of this but on an exponentially larger scale, with some ice at a high elevation. Ice ts took thousands of years to form, and they have been in retreat for thousands of years.  like this is likely to happen any time this millennium (longer for Antarctica) even WITH a big rise in global temperatures. Yes, climate change is real (and will put a lot of stress on the environment and humans). No, The Day After Tomorrow wasn't. You can all chill, pun intended  	31	6
2015-04-24 08:24:52	Scaly Khajiit	@ @***** @***** Well I thank you for your enlightening answers, I really learned something!  	19	5
2015-04-23 19:11:31	liguha	@Tancri Von Bouzin Much of desertification is a function of farming malpractice, deforestation and erosion of topsoil (think Dust Bowl or desertification from loss of tropical rainforest in /Africa). The excess heat and water vapor would lead to more rain. At the moment, the continents are also relatively widely d, meaning rainfall can easily reach the interiors of most continents. This is unlike Supercontinent Pangea, which was so massive (and right on the equator) that any rain or moisture would be nothing but wispy dust clouds by the time it made it to the interior of the continent. Given enough recovery of plant foliage to keep the topsoil intact, there would likely be lush forests all over the globe, with climatic conditions similar to the Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum (a time when there was little to no permanent ice on the planet). Of course, this would likely be VERY far down the road, and there will likely be massive desertification until we get to the "lush-tropical-forest" phase.  	30	2
2015-04-23 15:42:20	Scaly Khajiit	@ I get your point and see what you mean. Nonetheless, in general there would tend to be a desertification wouldn't be? I mean in Europe for instance, things would become more arid and inhospitable as the species aren't used to this particular climate  	36	2
2015-04-23 12:35:21	Thomas Simensen	@ Exactly, areas that are now forests might become deserts because of climate change (change of winds etc) and the other way around. But this video was about ocean levels, not forests :)  	5	3
2015-04-23 08:54:17	Maddinhpws	@Tancri Von Bouzin It could be, that the earth even cools down shortly after that, because the melting of the russian tundra for example would burst huge amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere (I heard it was 4 times the amount, the human race produced entirely). But also Heat does not always mean desertification. It could become even greener, because of more rain.  	5	2

Just the displacement of a shit ton more people, it doesn't matter whose land it is, but rather the largest amount of displaced people. Also do be so buthurt that they didn't show , they showed even less of Russia, and what do Russia and  have in common? Lots lots of harsh land with very few people.  	14	3

2015-04-23 00:46:56	Vincent Williams	Stop right at : Lake Eyre would not fill or flood, there is no direct outlet to the ocean. It's already below sea level, and yet it only floods once or twice per century when there are torrential rains.      Antarctica is a continent, with land mass underneath the ice; there is also land mass under 's ice. Yes, there's a lot of ice to melt off, and sure, perhaps the level of the oceans will differ. But 216 or so feet? Arctic ice, along with Antarctic ice that exists beyond the land mass is on water; when that ice melts, water levels are unlikely to change; it's called displacement.      Try it yourself. Fill a glass with ice, then fill the glass with water until it reaches the brim. When that ice melts, will the glass overflow, reduce, or stay the same? Most will guess the glass will overflow. Guess again.      The ocean levels are higher at the equator than at the poles, due to centrifugal force as the earth spins. Then you have tides, where the earth moves to meet the water (not the other way around!) There are a lot of variables, none taken into consideration by the alarmists or their computer models.      Is the earth ing? Perhaps. Is that a bad thing? No. You want th to grow crops. If you hope for a freeze instead, then you will have major problems, famine, etc. Good luck feeding the world if the average temperatures dip a few degrees. But, that's what Gore and his loonies want, apparently.  	31	6

2015-04-23 00:39:56	gaurdianAQ	So in this situation where they say all land ice melts, does that mean that basically in this scenario that all of the earth is now incapable of sustaining freezing temperatures? While a bunch of the earth would be flooded would that mean areas that were once not hospitable to live in (like a good percentage of russia) would now be more hospitable? And would that mean areas that are already  all year round would beco hot to live in?  	5	6

2015-04-18 02:37:31	ghost8982	I'm wondering how they concluded this. Ice is a solid, meaning if it melted, it would spread out. There is enough ice under the water in the north and south poles that if melted it would submerged a lot more then this. Possably the entire planet. With exceptions to China region mountains. You see here Florida disappears but not most of California. Is faults couldn't handle it for one but a lot of it is at sea level. This video makes absolutely no sense. Many sea level cities are not shown under water. But If you fill a glass with ice cubes and then fill it to the top with water, let it melt, the level remains the same and it does not overflow. So if the caps melted would anything change at all. Either way disproves this video.  	5	6

The water will rise once you put the ice in it, but be patient as the ice melts. Once you notice the ice cubes are gone, notice how the water level has risen above the line a little bit. Now take the  Pole Ice, and think of the Earth's land. Take rivers into account too.  	5	6

2015-04-23 00:53:17	Vincent Williams	@ If the earth heated enough to melt just the Antarctic ice alone, we'd have more problems than just extra water. Antarctic ice is miles thick, the deepest ice is thousands of years old. It's not melting away anytime soon. Arctic ice, on the other hand, fluctuates all the time, because it is on water. The NYT ran a piece on the lack of Arctic ice... back in the 1930s. Since then the Arctic ice has grown, diminished, grown again... it's a cycle. Antarctic ice, on the other hand, sits on top of a land mass and doesn't go anywhere, for millennia. It's the ocean ice that changes, again, just like the Arctic.  	5	6

2015-04-23 00:36:49	gaurdianAQ	@ Imaging you had a glass of water, then imagine on top of that glass you have a small screen that a big block of ice sits on. When the ice melts it will flow through the screen and into the glass causing it to over flow. It's not about the ice that's already in the water, it's all the ice that is either above sea level or on land. The ice that's in your water are already taking up  in the glass instead of water, but if you were to take an already full glass and put ice into it then the water overflows.  	33	6
2015-04-21 16:11:31	Jesse Prescott	@ Think of it this way. You have a glass, and the glass is 6 inches tall. There is a column of ice in the glass that is 4 feet tall. Only 6 inches of the ice is actually i the glass, and the rest is sticking out of it.When all of the ice melts, the water will not fit in the glass.  	33	6
2015-04-18 15:06:09	Keegan Barns	@ First of all. The polar ice caps are on a continent. Ice melts, water runs off into ocean. Lots of ice = lots of water  	5	6

2015-04-18 03:08:19	RadioTrefoil	@ Land ice =/= sea ice. Land ice does not displace ocean water! If you take a glass of water, and put a whole lot of ice in it's going to overflow. It's the same thing with rising sea levels. Most of Antarctica is land ice, and if it melts the water will flow into the ocean.  	5	6
2015-04-15 22:46:08	niamor314	@ The ice which causes the sea to rise is not floating pack ice (in Arctic), but ice caps and glaciers, which are on land, and melt in the sea (mostly the ice covering Groenland and Antarctica). So the ice was originally out of the sea and melts in it, which makes it rise. It's a common mistake. (and sorry if my english is bad)  	5	6

2015-04-05 05:06:10	Anxo Fernandez	This means that a lot of these places will have to be abandoned when the risk of disappearance becomes almost immediate. On the other hand, many other places on Earth where  lives right now, will slowly become more and more populated. It happened before during and after the last ice age and after the medieval  period. Humanas move around the planet looking for a better place to live. It's not the disappearance of a few cities and regions that should worry us, it's how that will affect the weather, like for example, will we have more or less hurricanes? How about tornados? Will there be big differences between winter and summer? Also, what influence will it have in vegetation and wild life? That's the kind of stuff we should worry about.  	31	1

Otros s perdedores parecen ser India y Argentina, Brasil al ser el destructor numero uno de ecosistemas de alta biodiversidad deberia verse más afectado, pero creo para ese entonces ya habrán acabado el verde de ese mapa. Me parece que el video discriminó a los gigantes rusia y ca, dejando un vacio importante, además de que se omitió presentar las nuevas tierras que dejaria al descubierto la capa de hielo de la antartica ( el continente mas elevado del mundo ).

2015-07-19 13:05:41	Hipster Michael Myers	@ManThatsANiceBanana They're theories, I do agree with that. There's so much debate of this in the U.S., it's impossible to know if there really is global ing or not. One side lies, and the other side lies and tries to put in some well thought out facts. (To a point where the public can agree, not visualize the whole analysis.They wouldn't know how to.) You'd have to do the research yourself. And even then if you come up with an answer and an explanation on the analysis, everyone does the same thing and it's usually bullshit. Calling others out on it will only cause them to call you out on it, then we're on the circle of bigotry. Sad, but unfortunately true. This is politics everybody. Welcome to the U.S.  	20	2

2015-07-02 04:11:42	Hipster Michael Myers	@ Lol, filter sewer water. But even then, that's not nearly enough. A lot can definitely happen, for sure.  will get hit pretty hard on the Western coast given that Japan has some Nuclear factories near the coast in some parts. If any of that gets near the U.S. (most notably Hawaii) we're in some pretty deep trouble.  	11	3
2015-07-01 16:43:44	Jesse Prescott	@ That's a good point. And who knows what that will do to the water supply. I don't know much about how water filtration works, and if it gets to a certain point where they just aren't able to get it clean enough to be safe. At least at a rate that's fast enough to keep up with consumption.  	11	3
2015-07-01 04:29:21	Hipster Michael Myers	@ Downie It'll definitely look like that if it just shows the landmass getting flooded. But what you have to worry about is the r though of cities drowning in the water. There's a lot of pollution and factories in cities of course, and if they get flooded, it's not like it's gonna be just sea water being present, everything in the buildings, factories, sewers, they're all gonna get in the water and spread around the world. The water will become EXTREMELY polluted and it'll float around the world causing oceanic pollution, death of sea life and birds. And this is happening in ALL continents. China's gonna have it real hard.  	31	3
2015-06-18 19:01:33	Canadian Devil Beelzaboot	@ Downie It's not about the "damage", it's the immigration, have you seen that ALL these major cities would be near flooded, these are metropolisses housing MILLIONS, where will tll go, some country are too densly populated already  	14	3

Yes, I realize it's impossible to move everyone and people will die. All I'm saying is that it doesn't seem as catastrophic for all of humanity than I would have thought before seeing this video.  	14	1
2015-04-24 22:53:38	Cablev94	@ You obviously don't know much about the world. Lets take China for example. You are talking about 1 BILLION people moving inland, which is impossible, because the parts of China that won't be affected by this would not be able to support that many people. It's either to dry or cold, and hardly any farmland, so moving inland is just not possible. This is true for a majority of people this would affect. We would need to re-locate these people to ,  , or Africa for them to survive, we are talking about re-locating half the planet. Like I said earlier, this is already happening to lots of small villages on the East Asian coast (villages who have been in the same location for generations without any coastal movement, now tre experiencing massive coastal movement, every year, over the last 10 years.) poor villages, who can not afford to move their entire village from the coast, not to mention the inland land in these areas are jungles, and are not farm-able. You are talking about a completely different way of life for million of people, changing from a farming/fishing village to having to learn how to live in the jungle with out farming. If we have learned anything with history its that you need good farmland in order to support a lot of people, without it there will be a massive population loss. While their governments do nothing to help them. These countries would experience massive population losses, which WILL affect our country's economy.  	31	3
2015-04-23 20:20:33	Tachibana	@ why do you assume its going to take 500 years? sure its probably not going to happen overnight, thats unlikely, but it can definitely happen in 1 life time  	18	1
2015-04-23 17:37:12	Jesse Prescott	@***** You seem to be very intelligent. Please see my "100s to 1000s of years" section of my comment. You think your great great grandchildren will be forced to stand still for years while they slowly drown? No one's home is going to suddenly be washed away overnight without any warning. "The sea level is getting closer. We should think about moving back in about 10 years or so". This is all irrelevant, because all of the ice in the world is never going to melt, it's all hypothetical. It's cute that you care so much about the poor villagers that can't simply up and pack up their tents of the time span of 500 years. Maybe you should go and help them.  	31	6
2015-04-23 16:53:09	Jess Castro	@ Downie You do realize that pretty much all of china and india go underwater...that's def where a majority of the earths entire population resides....where do you think they will suddenly go ?  	14	1
2015-04-23 16:10:14	Jesse Prescott	@ Yeah, that part I don't really care about tbh. This would take multiple generations to actually happen. If people can't figure out how to walk 10 miles inland in 100s or 1000s of years, then they deserve to die. Chaitanya did have a good point, though. There could be many after effects that would be more devastating than just moving back a little.  	3	1

2015-04-23 01:35:06	Cablev94	@ Maybe you should watch some documentaries on coastal villages around the world who suffer from this over the past 10 years, while their governments do nothing to relocate them. A majority of the people this will affect can not afford to move.  	14	1
2015-04-23 01:32:55	Cablev94	@ Downie Not much damage? 80% of the planets population lives on the coast.1 billion people live in the area of China that would be affected. You are talking about displacing 80% of the planets population, a MAJORITY of which are very very poor.  	14	1
2015-04-23 01:07:02	Chaitanya Bhagwat	@ this video shows only the geogical side of the story. because of the rising water level, a significant number of species from both plant and animal life will go extinct. this means there is even elss biodiversity, meaning our crops can be at risk for superdiseases, adding massive food shortages on a global scale to the list. this is just one example of a far reaching consequence.  	31	2

2015-04-23 00:05:20	Anno Mimicus	@ Downie Most of the world's population live next to a coast, so pretty much everyone will be fucked.  	3	1

But they make this whole global ing thing seem like it's the end of humanity. This shows that over hundreds of years (I'd assume, just taking a guess), we'd have to migrate inland. That's assuming we don't go into a cooling cycle.  	3	2

2015-04-04 13:22:01	Mr. Pabliti	Eso puede suceder dentro de muchos años, en los cuales se supone ninguno de nosotros deberiamos estar vivos, de lo que si hay que preocuparse del terremoto mundial que en el corto plazo estremecerà a la tierra y bajo el cual desapareceràn s ciudades y las islas seràn movidas (no estoy seguro si algunas desapareceràn),; tambien hay que preocuparse de la posible caida de un asteroide en el mar que pueda provocar s tsunamis en las costas que segun he visto lo estàn pronosticando para el proximo año ( aunque soy cauteloso para creerlo es algo que hay que seguir). Busquen al Señor Jesucristo que todavia hay tiempo para que se salven y eviten estar bajo el castigo de Dios que viene sobre la Tierra. El Señor Jesucristo es el Arca de Noè de estos tiempos,pero recuerden que la puerta tambien se cerrarà a su debido tiempo.  	31	2

2015-04-23 21:58:21	Juicebronco	@ Brown The water is running out of the Great Lakes and into the ocean via the St. Lawrence and Erie canal. The reason the water is flowing that direction is because it is downhill. Water always runs downhill. Lake Ontario is 243 feet above sea level. So if sea level rose 216 feet, it wouldn't even get to Lake Ontario, let alone climb the 167 foot tall Niagara falls to get to Lake Erie. Many areas along the St Lawrence and Erie Canal would flood long before the great lakes would see any change at all. I think  is correct, in that it's made to scare people and not an accurate portrayal of what the earth would look like if all the ice melted.  	31	3

2015-04-03 20:02:07	Prime Minister	On the plus side the Sahara and the Out back in  will be turned from desert to green lands.   Most of the cities are safe and those that are not can afford to erect coastal barriers.  	30	3
2015-04-23 16:13:00	Prime Minister	@ Poulter There is no point crying over spilt milk. We have to look on the bright side a see what can be done to lessen the impact to people who have to relocated from coastal areas.  	1	3
2015-04-23 12:51:51	Martin Poulter	You're proposing the biggest ever irrigation project as though it's easy. Why do you think it would "reduce the impact of increasing water levels"? That's a strange claim! You said "On the plus side the and the Out back in  will be turned from desert to green lands," as though it would be a consequence of the ice melting, but it wouldn't be. It would be a consequence of a completely unrelated idea that you think is feasible.  	11	6

2015-04-23 00:28:44	Alextropics	@Dear Mum But desalination is not only expensive, but it takes a lot of energy (which releases more greenhouse gases). You are not gonna get desalination to run on solar anytime soon  	11	3
2015-04-04 19:58:50	Prime Minister	@ Poulter to help reduce the impact of increasing water levels the logic course would be to desalinate and pump it i into arid areas thus turning the Sahara and Out back in to regions like the Nile delta.  	11	3
2015-04-04 17:19:26	Martin Poulter	@Dear Mum Citation? With desert areas getting hotter, how are they going to turn into green lands? "Most of the cities are safe"- did you watch the video? The sea will reclaim many huge coastal cities with millions of people each. As for coastal barriers, look at the video and see how big the coastal barriers are going to have to be. How can anyone afford that?  	31	2

2015-04-03 19:02:16	Rodrigusificacionn	I don't know about science so my opinion now could be wrong but, if there is enough temperature for melting ALL the ice then wouldn't there be enough temperature for vaporizing the water of the see faster so maybe situation wouldn't be like that, and it would be like a tropical sauna... Not everywhere. I don't know. Just thinking.  	33	6
2015-04-04 18:27:49	Rodrigusificacionn	@ Poulter Yes. At least it would be very different to the weather today. About the sea level, I always have understood that it should rise, but I was just thinking another options. Thank you for answering.  	5	3
2015-04-04 18:00:48	Martin Poulter	I think the predictions basically agree with you. More heat in the atmosphere *and* more water in the atmosphere make for bad news as regards extreme weather. There'd be sea level rise as depicted in the video, *plus* weather changes that would take different forms in different parts of the world.  	5	2
2015-04-04 17:48:13	Rodrigusificacionn	@ Poulter Perhaps it would rain more but not that much. Perhaps there would be just more clouds everywhere... I really don't know. I don't try to be against any theory.  	5	3
2015-04-04 17:24:45	Martin Poulter	@ Increased heat would mean more evaporation from the sea, but more water in the air means more rain falling. Result: some more water in the air, but more extreme weather and not enough to counteract sea level rise. This sort of thing is explicitly included in climate models.  	5	3
2015-04-03 18:59:54	Andrej Panev	There will be no changes because all the ice is frozen water so the weight of the ice keeps the water on the same level.Try putting an ice cube in glass then fill it with water, mark the water level then wait for the ice to melt and see the results the water keeps the same level so nothing will happen if all the ice on the earth is melted.  	5	6
2015-04-23 16:43:54	essam fayyaz	@ Panev If we take consideration of your theory. the water level remains unchanged. Do you see that all the frozen ice is pure water.. that mixing with the salt water is going to cause all sorts of super hurricanes n typhoons and unexplained weather phenomena.. either way we are fucked.. but then your theory is wrong because most of the ice is on land..  	5	6
2015-04-04 17:21:12	Martin Poulter	@ Panev Your argument works for ice that is already *floating in water*, and if we ignore the thermal expansion of the oceans. What do you say about the ice which is *on land*: thousands of cubic kilometers of it? Is your theory that that can melt and run into the sea and there be "no change"?  	5	6
2015-04-03 20:22:23	Muskar	Try putting water in a soup plate, and then put ice cubes on the rim. Observe to see if the water level changes before and after they melt. My point is, it's not the ice that is already in the sea that's important in this case - it's the ice on land.  	5	6

All the top soil was washed away by "salt water" so nothing will grow there anymore. Cause? Maybe a BIG snowball, or more likely, an oceanic hit by a large meteor, or many of them. It may have taken "40 days" for the water to rise, but much longer for it to recede...the surviving humans have been divided ever since.  	31	3

2015-04-14 08:11:10	panterablanca9999	@ El PIB per capita,si es el que tiene mas valor pero también el PBI ,ya que hace a los países mas ricos y potencias y en eso Argentina aventaja bastante a Chile,y en el PBI per capital no es mucho ya que hace dos años Argentina estaba primero este año Chile y así esta la pelea,hasta leí que Argentina en los años siguientes lo volverá a pasar a Chile igual siempre esta parejo en eso y eso que Argentina tiene mucha mas población que Chile,que tiene mucho que ver ya que completando los países que siguen en el top 5 están Uruguay y panamá países con baja población.Por eso digo es un gran merito de Argentina estar en el podio de los 2 indicadores económicos mas .En deporte Chile no se resalta en casi  amigo Argentina es por lejos mas fuerte en cultura y música,tecnología muchas cosas.Te reto a que me menciones 10 personajes chilenos reconocidos en el mundo.  	24	0

Also they failed to mention that we might be heading there either way since we're in a ing period after an ice age. Still we cannot predict what will really happen.      But no doubt doomsaying is much more entertaining (and perfectly fitting the leftards political agenda, too) than the fact that we just cannot predict the future of a huge and infinitely complex thing as the earths climate.  	31	2

2015-04-03 03:26:31	Daniel Alpert	What I don't get is that the left thinks humans are the worst thing on this planet. So why is it bad if the results of man on the planet causes the largest costal cities to be destroyed? I don't get that.      Incidentally, I'm going to trust what God said regarding floods.      Genesis 9:8-16 NIV   8 Then God said to Noah and to his sons with him: 9 “I now establish my covenant with you and with your descendants after you 10 and with every living creature that was with you—the birds, the livestock and all the wild animals, all those that came out of the ark with you—every living creature on earth. 11 I establish my covenant with you: Never again will all life be destroyed by the waters of a flood; never again will there be a flood to destroy the earth.”   12 And God said, “This is the sign of the covenant I am making between me and you and every living creature with you, a covenant for all generations to come:13 I have set my rainbow in the clouds, and it will be the sign of the covenant between me and the earth. 14 Whenever I bring clouds over the earth and the rainbow appears in the clouds, 15 I will remember my covenant between me and you and all living creatures of every kind. Never again will the waters become a flood to destroy all life. 16 Whenever the rainbow appears in the clouds, I will see it and remember the everlasting covenant between God and all living creatures of every kind on the earth.”  	31	2

2015-04-06 20:16:34	Gonzalo Fuentes	@ Amigo, usted esta generalizando, no se porque la fijación por atacar al chileno, porque si cualquier persona hiciera lo mismo con ustedes seria peor. Sabes por que hay tanto inmigrante en Chile? Gran parte de ellos vienen a delinquir, y lo peor es que después hablan mal de nosotros. Si ustedes vienen a ponerse al servicio de los chilenos cosa suya, pero luego no hablen de prepotencia. Que raro que el pais mas "malo" ha crecido mas? Que ganas de ayudar van a dar cuando los mismos paises te apuñalan por la espalda? PD: Se nota que no sabe debatir, porque no puede poner una opinion personal como argumento.

2015-04-06 16:51:10	Gonzalo Fuentes	@ Amigo, usted esta muuuy equivocado, nuestros vecinos buscan roces y siendo objetivos nosotros somos mas que "buenos vecinos", porque en varias ocasiones nuestro vecinos han hecho provocaciones que podrían llevar a una guerra. 1. Soldados bolivianos entran a Chile para asaltar. 2.Para que hablar de Perú, si ellos mismos han hecho comentarios Antichilenos abiertamente (ollanta humala) y varias cosas mas. 3.Se sabe que estos dos países son conflictivos, los roces con Ecuador y Brasil son prueba de ello.  	24	0

2015-04-06 03:48:51	Gonzalo Fuentes	@ El unico delito que veo aqui es tu ortografía amigo, no porque un pais sea mas desarrollado hay que odiarlo, todo eso es por envidia o revanchismo por los errores del pasado.

Buenos Aires es como una mini Europa en América, y es muchísimo mas  que Santiago. aradas, Santiago parece un pueblito xD Imagínate que cuando viajé en avión, desde una altura se podía ver todo Santiago, TODO. Desde el centro iluminado hasta la última ampolleta mas alejada. Nuestra ciudad de europea cada vez tiene menos, ya que a los empresarios ctm se les ocurre derrumbar edificios de principios del siglo XX y poner sus weás cuadradas sin mínimo arte. Y Valparaíso! Pucha que ciudad mas descuidada... edificios hermosos que se desmantelan por la poca preocupación de las autoridades. Esos cuadros y dibujos que uno ve de Valparaíso, y todo ese cuento de "la joya del Pacífico" y "la ciudad mas hermosa de Chile" cada vez le queda menos. Lo único que se ve son caca de perro everywhere, basura y edificios, que si los miras con detenimiento, tiene detalles hermosísimos y arquitectura preciosa, pero obviamente, no faltan los rayados y la pintura que nunca se volvió a repasar. :C  	24	0

2015-04-02 16:44:29	Marina PDG	The density of water at room temperature is 0.998g/cm³ , that of water just near the freezing point is 0.9998 g/cm³. The density of ice is 0.9167 g/cm³. The ratio of volumes is inversely proportional to the ratio of densities. So, for example, one gallon of water near the freezing point would make the equivalent of 1.090 gallons of ice. This video is invalid.  	33	6
2015-04-04 17:12:42	Martin Poulter	@ Thousands of cubic kilometers of ice are presently on land. If they melted, they would run into the sea and raise the global sea level. How are the figures you quote even relevant to this?  	5	6
2015-04-04 15:51:45	MrCurlykid1	@ If you want to attempt to insult my intelligence try to spell the  science right you fucking moron. Newsflash shitforbrains,  and Antarctica AREN'T FLOATING IN THE WATER. It's called SURFACE Ice because it sits on the SURFACE... wow what a novel concept. Go back to playing with legos and picking boogers off the bottom of your desk kid. Fucking bringing buoyancy up like you are pulling out a trump card when Buoyancy has NOTHING to do with the situation at hand. Again, the KILOMETERS thick SURFACE ice is on LAND. The Sea ice is at MOST 1 meter thick and melts every 6 months and then re-freezes, SEA Ice has NOTHING to do with sea level rise. It's about the SURFACE ice which is on LAND and not floating in the fucking ocean you twit. Retards like you need to be made sterile.  	5	6

2015-04-02 19:03:12	Atli30	Marina....I've read that about half the flooding due to global ing will be from the expansion of the individual water molecules....the other half from ice turning into water.  	33	6
2015-04-02 17:09:14	MrCurlykid1	Maybe you missed the part in kindergarten where sea water contains more than just H2O and has salt mixed in, which makes your comment, invalid. Try not to hurt yourself when they get to the lessons on colors.  	37	3

Please, you've got between 2 and 3 peer reviewed articles that I had to bring up that agree with you and I'd be willing to bet you've never read them, have NO idea which studies I'm talking about, have NO idea where they were even published. All you've got are ideas and propaganda fed into your brain from Murdoch News aka Fox. Newsflash shitforbrains, Murdoch has a vested interest in watching the world burn. Most of his money is in oil. What do you stand to gain from your ignorance? This isn't a debate.  is the only country on the planet where more than 20% of the population is on your side. Get your passport, go see the world. Climate change can be seen in real time in Venice, the southern coast of Florida, Bangladesh. New York City is already amassing a sea wall. Do you think the financial industry would spend the trillion dollars tre to prevent New York City from going underwater for no reason? Live in denial all you want, when I visit Antarctica and the 100foot thick ice t I was walking on 18 months ago is 100% gone then you have no foot to stand on scrub. Go try to spew your horseshit uneducated denialist lies at some other trailer park n that will listen. You are the minority, the rest of the human species is going to cull all you that denied science when the mass migration of humans that is coming begins. Your days are numbered.  	20	2
2015-04-02 17:38:40	Rich	Also your assertion that people should be culled from society and made and example of prove to me what a Nazi you actually are. If that is what is in your heart then you are capable of murder to satisfy your need to silence any dissent. You are representative of the psychotic filth promulgating the biggest hoax since Aztecs slaughtered humans to control the climate.  	38	2
2015-04-02 17:35:28	Rich	No you are wrong. The sea level is on track to rise 12" every 100 years as it has been since the last ice age. I am an atheist, there is nothing I could ever say to dissuade them from their fervent belief. You, as a true believer in the Church of Man Made Climate Scientology are no different. Maybe 2 out of 10000 peer reviewed studies have been correct as are the computer model's. Tll have been tweaked and none of them have proven correct.  	31	2
2015-04-02 17:23:16	MrCurlykid1	@ P The only thing you are right about is "the ocean has been higher and lower". Correct. The last time CO2 levels were as high as tre now the sea level was 50 feet higher than it is today. The entire ice t of  is melting, fact. I can find you HUNDREDS of scientists in every field from climate to oceanogy that say it is. Sea level rise of 6 inches in less than 2 years has ALREADY been measured on the ENTIRE US Eastern Seaboard/Gulf Coast. Out of 10,000 Peer Reviewed Studies on climate change on 3, yes THREE dissented from the consensus that climate change is happening AND it is manmade. Let me say that again, 3 out of 10,000 peer reviewed studies agree with you. Best case projections show 1 foot rise a year for the next half a century. Get your passport and travel the world and get out of  where this echo chamber of anti-science exists.

2015-04-02 04:51:47	Rich	@debunkerman I did not mean the Oceans are not rising, that is normal, around 1 foot every 100 years for the last 10,000 years. I meant all the ice is not going to disappear in the next few hundred thousand years and I doubt man will be here by then  	31	6
2015-04-02 04:50:06	Rich	@debunkerman LOL No it has happened in the past but there were no subways. 100 years is a microcosm of time. The ocean has been higher and lower than it is today.  	31	3

2015-04-23 01:18:24	ATP19XX	@ seems to be stupidiest ignorant I've seen to date. If a continent, country, city or whatever doesn't experience those four seasons, it doesn't change the fact that *Earth* has four seasons: Winter, Spring, Summer, Fall. If I recall, it's mediterranean countries that has summer around a year with lowest "winter" temperatures spinning around +8 and +10 celcius in december-january, where as example any of the arctic countries can have anywhere between -30 to +4 (estimate, probably not too accurate). Then if we take summer time, those arctic countries are lucky to hit +30 celcius. That's pretty much low-guess average in mediterranean areas. But hey.. Why am I typing this one. That kid probably don't even know what is "celcius", or mediterranean for that matter. These are not so easy topics for low graders.  	31	2

2015-04-09 21:28:19	Marco Caria	consider this a bonus to your intelligence since i am kinda bored ill just answer you that yes even russia experiences all 4 seasons and its not youtube thats gonna tell you otherwise dude theres also no need to graduation man just get yourself a geogy teacher i serious.  russia experiences it better since tre closer to the tropic and so in summer the sun will heat that zone more that northern russia, but northern russia also does experience seasons, did you know that in the north pole and regions near it (northern russia) have 6 months of day and 6 months of night? because the earth is sideways until it completes half a orbit around the sun it will be allways dark/light. jesus and I thought everyone knew this, I guess im even more ignorant than these people for thinking everyone knows it and im fuking 15.  	35	2
2015-04-09 21:14:51	MrCurlykid1	@ Lmao Russia experiences 4 seasons huh? Thats news to, well basically ALL OF RUSSIA.

2015-04-09 20:50:19	Marco Caria	@ dude plz. its fuking common sense that only the counries near to equator dont experience seasons. like have you ever fuking had a geogy class? the earth is not fuking perfect it is kinda sideways and when it goes around the sun (did you know?) it makes some parts of the planet closer to sun than other creating summer/autumn/winter/spring. dont even bother answering me i am not wasting any more of my time with extremely ignorant people.  	35	2

2015-04-02 18:56:51	MrCurlykid1	@***** Bahahah, you were too fucking stupid to realize that fresh water density =/= salt water density and you want me to watch something based on your recommendation? Lmfao, the extra chromosome is strong in you. Please go back to kindergarden and have them teach you about saltwater and how things dissolve in fluids, when you understand the BASICS of this discussion then your opinion might be valid. I'd say it will take you at least 6 months to fully understand salt dissolved in water, after 6 months has passed you can comeback and give your opinion then. Until then stfu scrubmuffin and enjoy the dumbest fuck on Youtube award you earned today.  	38	3
2015-04-02 17:31:12	MrCurlykid1	@***** Sigh, look at this uneducated fuck that doesn't understand the difference between sea-ice and surface-ice. The surface-ice sitting on top of Antarctica and  that is melting is KILOMETERS THICK, the sea-ice that "is at record highs" is at MOST 1 meter thick. Just for your small brain to reference 1000 meters = 1 Kilometer. The surface ice is all fresh water, when it melts it lowers the salinity level of the seawater which allows the water to freeze at lower temperatures so you get more of the sea-ice floating on the surface near the poles. Stay in school you moron, this concept is understood by elementary school children when they see salt being put on the roads to make the ice melt and I'm having to explain it to you. Fucking pathetic, go play in traffic with that sub 80 IQ brain of yours.  	31	6

2015-04-06 21:32:17	MrCurlykid1	@ High five you actually know something about subsidence, that has a very small roll to play in what is happening in Venice. Over half of the world's top 100 cities sit at the same sea level as Venice. In regards to sea ice, I'm beyond sick of explaining this utterly elementary concept. The surface ice (KEY WORD SURFACE) is KILOMETERS THICK and has been around for THOUSANDS of years. The sea ice is a SINGLE METER thick and is seasonal, like the ice on a pond it comes and goes. The entire pacific ocean could freeze with 1 meter thick ice, guess what? It doesn't equal the amount of water trapped on the SURFACE of  and Antarctica. Furthermore, the melting of the SURFACE ice will result in more sea ice forming in polar regions...why you ask? Because the SURFACE ice is fresh water with 0% salt. Since that is melting it is lowering the salinity of the surrounding water which if you remember from 2nd grade science class, the more salt water has in it the lower it's freezing point is so adding fresh water back in is going to raise the freezing temperature allowing the 1 meter thick sea ice to form at higher temperatures than previously.. I hope these simple concepts are breaking thru to you, but odds are you've sipped too much of the denialist koolaid.  	31	6

You are just asking retarded fucking questions that would get you laughed out of a 100 level community college course. Go back to listening to fools like n Beck and Rush, they cater to weak minds like you that can't grasp simple fucking concepts. Come on you stupid shill, show humanity what we all have wrong with just one of Newton's laws of Motion, or if that's too complicated try Graham's law. Come on just 1 that's what you said you would do, tell humanity what they didn't know about established scientific facts. Those are the scientific laws and you still haven't shown us anything, pathetic. Do humanity a favor and go dance in front of traffic.  	35	2

You're gonna have a tougher time describing time, or mass itself. You're going to have an even tougher time telling me why the hell certain persons found it necessary to build, I don't know, say, the CERN accerlerator.

Does it change when I type it here vs link you to it in Wikipedia? NOPE. Please continue to stroke your own ego by taking swipes at Wikipedia, if you think your single brain has more knowledge within it than Wikipedia you are way past the dip shit title I gave you earlier.

Stop wasting time, if you're next reply doesn't even at least ATTEMPT to "Show you how little you know about them" one SINGLE fucking law on this page then you are just a troll that needs to be culled from existence. Please get to it enough stroking your 2 inch cock and ego, explain to us all what we don't know about the Laws of Thermodynamics. How about Stefan–Boltzmann law? Come on enlighten humanity via Youtube comment, they give out Nobel's for youtube now right?   	35	2

2015-04-05 22:22:02	MrCurlykid1	@Ahnootha Luhva You said "Well, go on and show me the thing we "fully understand," and I'll show you how little you know about them." I give you a link to a wikipedia page with THE LAWS OF SCIENCE and you go on and on with ad hominem's. You're a theist, I can smell your kind from thousands of miles away. Go troll some religious thread with your pathetic shit, if I want to have a conversation with a dipshit like yourself I'll squat and pinch one out.  	37	2
2015-04-05 22:01:25	AnotherLover	@ Slow down, curlykid. You're way off track and you're making so little sense I don't even know where to begin with you. When did I talk about religion? And when did I ask you what science is? My original post described science. You reply with... a definition of science that supports what I said, and now you want me to read a Wikipedia page? Talk about your entitlement society. I don't owe you anything. If there's anything in your post that describes science as something other than a method of investigating the truth go on and lay it down for me. And tell your friend to stop lying.  	37	2
2015-04-05 17:54:04	MrCurlykid1	@Ahnootha Luhva  blah blah, stop asking your empty brained questions and go on. Prove these wrong, educate the world in a Youtube comment what the human race has wrong about any of these and feel free to edit the page with your overwhelming knowledge of belly button lint.  You're a theist, it's overwhelmingly clear. Go back to your book of fairy tales by humans that didn't even know were the Sun went at night.  	37	2
2015-04-05 16:35:14	AnotherLover	@ More from you? When did I ask you for a definition? Thanks for looking up the  "science." You're that much better off. You're thinking is clearly unclear. How you could have arrived at your conclusion I have no idea. You're 100% wrong and, it just tickles me to picture the rusty levers clanking around inside your head to produce such trite crap.  	37	2
2015-04-05 16:15:22	MrCurlykid1	@Ahnootha Luhva You are laughably ignorant and whatever weed you are smoking you need to put down. Stop asking for definitions of s when you can fucking google it yourself. Science. noun 1. a branch of knowledge or study dealing with a body of facts or truths systematically arranged and showing the operation of general laws: the mathematical sciences. 2. systematic knowledge of the physical or material world gained through observation and experimentation. 3. any of the branches of natural or physical science. 4. systematized knowledge in general. 5. knowledge, as of facts or principles; knowledge gained by systematic study. 6. a particular branch of knowledge. 7. skill, especially reflecting a precise application of facts or principles; proficiency. Take your half baked ideas and go back to church where you came up with them, your mind has definitely been warped by the bane on humanity that is religion/theism.  	37	2
2015-04-05 14:45:45	AnotherLover	@y P Hold on, I can't tell. You talkin' to me, y P? I really can't tell. My comment is explicitly about science, and none of the others are. But I defend science against loud and ic assertions like "science is truth." You agree with me that science is a tool for investigating things we "don't yet fully understand." Well, go on and show me the thing we "fully understand," and I'll show you how little you know about them. We could do that all day long, because the last thing that science is is settled. It is not a dead subject, nor is scientific knowledge an immutable body only to be piled on but never broken down. In some academic circles 5-10 year old knowledge is irrelevant. If you insist that science is the truth you're simply ignorant. Of course, there is the chance you weren't even talking to me. Peace  	35	2

2015-04-04 10:33:47	Scott P	Science is there to investigate matters that we do not fully yet comprehend. This is to stop people like yourself spouting false facts and claiming it is the truth much like the many false prophets of olden times. Without science we would all be as ignorant. :)  	37	2
2015-04-04 03:36:23	AnotherLover	@MrCurlykid: I have a question about something Mr. DeGrasse said. He told an audience recently that "Science is the truth." It seems to me a scientist would know otherwise. Science is a method used to investigate the truth, not the truth itself. When new theories replace the old, so does new knowledge replace old knowledge. What was the value of that old knowledge, then? Was it not discovered by the scientific method? And was it not found, later, to be irrelevant? At what point, however, has the truth been found irrelevant? I'm not impressed.  	20	2

Newsflash, it's at the same sea-level as NYC and surrounding area and guess what, it's already underwater. Time to wake up and stop denying evidence that is already in your face. The financial sector i.e. the banks are themselves financing a seawall to prevent NYC from going under.

2017-07-03 17:23:40	Shawn Lewis	@ lol you're obviously avoiding sources that are unbiased. it's not even argued amongst rational people because of how apparent global ing is. but I'm not going to insult you, because every person needs to be aware and involved in trying to help in any way they can. Let's say I'm not going to convince you about global ing...but just look at any unbiased, scientifically produced evidence and  will tell you the glaciers (or rather the pole caps) are growing. But here is areason to start using alternative energy than c02 producing energy... If every house had a solar panel for a roof, and wind farms to produce energy, all connected to a grid that can evenly produce energy and using batteries to store energy when the sun is down, that allows a country to be completely sustain their own energy without needing to drill for oil or mine for coal (which is as shitty of a job and a dangerous one at that) to get oil. Also using new energy not only allows a country to sustain itself with free energy (once it's invested into), it would be cheaper because it's literally natural and always present, unlike oil which countries like the middle east profit heavily from and others like my country, the US, UK, and others get involved in wars that are to beat "terrorism" when its really about installing a leader that will be friendly and allow us cheap access to oil which causes massive debt from wars, casualties, and keeps the military industrial complex stocked. Do we get involved in conflicts in Africa, of which there are just as many as in the middle east? no, because there simply isn't any return on investment. So it becomes a question of whether or not you want a country that doesn't depend on others for energy, but can sustain itself without having to worry about eventually running out of oil. Even  which has large deposits, still exports a bunch so it's not as if they have an unlimited supply, besides, like I said it is a fiscally conservative thing to do. You create renewable energy, you pay less for it in the end. Yes the initial investment may cost, but that also brings in jobs, so it's good for the economy then, and good for the economy once the system is in place because when the energy is coming from wind and the sun, there's no shortage of that, and thus you pay less for all energy all around, whether it's for an electric car (which are increasingly better than a combustion engine, considering you never have to worry about it fucking up because of the filth that runs through an engine), no oil changes, just charging your car off the same energy you'd have from a renewable energy infrastructure. Plus, utilities would cost nearly nothing, except maybe the cost of the companies or government to maintain the energy grid. I think people should worry and realize global ing is a threat, but for deniers and for people that believe in global ing, it's also a positive reason to frame the debate into an economic one. it's just the smart thing to do. If the world isn't ing, how does that hurt anyone? It saves lives and helps them by giving jobs to people, as well as not getting involved in wars that have nothing to do with us, nor depending on countries charging outlandish prices. s  	31	2

2017-06-24 10:29:23	Shawn Lewis	While areas not near the sea would not be affected by rising sea levels....EVERYONE in the world would be affected by displaced citizens that live on the coast. Many of the most prosperous cities in the US, , the UK (which is an island itself), and many areas in Africa, near Middle Eastern seas would all see people have to move inland. This would create an influx of refugees that are not what we think of as "refugees" of war. These will be people from all nationalities, areas of the world, and will significantly create problems over overpopulation for areas not affected, as well as countless deaths that will inevitably happen from flooding. No matter how we look at it, this is going to affect the entire world, whether or not you live near a sea/ocean. This isn;'t even taking into account the rise in temperature.  	31	3

2015-04-08 15:51:33	Rolman80 80	@ You want me to spell out for you and remember english not even my frist language.  	24	5
2015-04-08 15:11:40	Stevon Robb	@ I have absolutely no idea at all what you are going on about. You make no sense at all. What does land, gold and the year 1492 have anything to do with my question? You shouldn't surf the internet while being  my friend.  	35	5
2015-04-08 14:19:27	Rolman80 80	@ That is call being a hipocrit something very well learn from the spanish and many other european cultures how they pretend to be your friend but as soon as you turn around stab in the back to steal land and gold. This is 2015 mate not 1492. I will use all the tool at my disposal for my own gains even being a hipocrit to you laugh infront of your face to get your money knowledge technology etc and when you are of no use to us any more well...... use your creative part of your brain.  	24	5
2015-04-08 13:50:47	Stevon Robb	@ Serious question... do you not at all see the absolute irony in your arguement? You are using a computer and also which I would assume the operating system is Microsoft Windows, using it to surf the internet to go on Youtube to watch videos and comment..... You are literally using every single thing the west invented, created and is responsible for to bash on the west. Please be honest and admit that surely is at least a little bit ironic.  	37	5
2015-04-08 13:33:12	Stevon Robb	@ I am going to take a guess and say you must live in a pretty crap shit hole country. It has become quite evident that you are in fact jealous of our vastly superior quality of life. I bet you blame the west on a lot of things for your situation in your poor nation. What makes a Utopia is the people, I am sorry you live in a country where the people are less intelligent to the point you live in such decrepid conditions. Really the only people to blame is yourselves for not doing anything about it, not the big bad evil west. I suggest you go out there and actually make some changes instead of sitting there blaming a bunch of countries.  	37	2
2015-04-08 12:45:26	Stevon Robb	@ What?.... man what the fuck are you blabbing on about? I can't tell if you are a troll or just really this stupid. Fact of the matter is if you dont like oil go live in a log cabin. You sit here all high and mighty ing about it and yet how do you think your computer was made? Why do you think the internet exists? Every technological thing we have is due to oil, it is the most essential thing to our civilization. Yes oil comes with a price but the fact of the matter we NEED it to operate a civilized society like it or not. You sit here bashing on the west, the west is the very one responsible for basically every great advancement in human history. Exactly where the hell do you live? If you really want to be a warrior go to a forest and pitch a tent. Have a confortable life. This world wasn't built on fairy dust bud.  	38	2
2015-04-08 00:01:42	Rolman80 80	@ Yes but this oil is extremely dirty oil so much chemicals and the waste is even  how can you possible call your self a canadian and do this to your own land may it dont make sense to me unless you are people who only care for your own wealth and as I meantion the human right violation of the local communities that are the true owner but once again typical western imperlialism that you do and undo as you please with out any care for anything or anyone. we need to evolve as global society but unfortunately this will never happen peacefully but only by violence and I m not talkit about this eco terrorist but a ww3.  	11	2
2015-04-07 23:43:19	Rolman80 80	@ Is your internet being censor or something that people can find the information they want so they can make up their own mind what is wrong or what is right.? If people are choosing to become pro enveriment or eco nazis may be is because they have free choice and they have logic or what you want to by typical white western man and want to force people to beileve your ways. and if people dont want to believe your ways you grab and gun start killing everyone or bring a plane down full of people. Because that how it usually goes. you act as if we are living in 1940 germany burning books with out any access to information.  	20	2
2015-04-07 23:42:08	mrryencoke	@ Roll another one Rolman. Do you figure consumer demand for oil and usage will decrease if the oil sands arent developed? If it doesnt come from , it will come from somewhere else like the middle east, where there is zero environmental protection legislation. Please share the source of your human rights violation accusations? Last I checked, those accusations were found to be without merit and the cancer rates of said reservation were on par with everyone else in Alberta.  	1	2
2015-04-07 23:38:47	Rolman80 80	@ Nazis is western phenomenon I dont care about any your western bullshit propaganda so tell it to  who cares or willing to listen to you so you can change their mind. You are top polluting people in this planet live your life the way you want to live it but everything has consequences in this planet everything. And your oil sand and mining industry will have a deep cost for you people in the long run. People in europe asia africa understand the importance of our forest and animals clean water etc you are either part of the problem or the solution. When shit hits the fan people decide to boycott everything canadian and this climate change problem get worst dont wine like little girls.  	20	2
2015-04-07 23:20:01	Stevon Robb	@ I really wish non Canadians would stop getting false information about our oil sands from all these eco nazis. I live in Calgary Alberta and have seen it first hand and have friends that work in that industry. The sands are the most tightly regulated of any oil project and the only project with GHG regulations in the world. They spend BILLIONS reclaiming the land after they have taken the oil out of the sand. Those horrible pictures you see are of mining in progress, they don't just fucking leave the place like that, they reclaim every square inch *by law*. And as far as emisions they produce LESS than 2 out of the very many coal plants in the United States each year. So if you wanna  about something eco go picket a coal plant in .  	31	2
2015-04-07 23:09:59	Rolman80 80	@ So oil tar sand are not pollution is chocolate factory right? how many barrels of tar oil is this producing every must be quite a bit to built a pipe line accros the US tha will cost billion. Not to mention the human right violation of the native people which are slowly being killed by cancer but ofcourse tre not human so they dont matter right. Typical western shit man only you people believe your own propaganda.  	38	2
2015-04-07 22:56:39	mrryencoke	@ Im relieved to know we have environmental super heroes targeting visual appeal rather then actual environmental pollution. No doubt the active sites are uglier then sin, but you seem to have the impression that these sites are abandoned as is upon completion and that isnt true. Reclamation of these projects is strictly regulated and second to none.  	20	2
2015-04-07 21:41:50	Rolman80 80	@ And you are part of such system an eco terrorist and  uses terror to terrorize the environment to achieve its goal of greed and power. This people are environmental super heroes fighting for our planet. Take a look at the oil tar sands man is a horrific sight you might be right about more pollution from this power plants but visually this oil tar sand is the worst I ve ever seem visually.  	20	2
2015-04-07 21:28:04	mrryencoke	@ Crock of shit. Eco-terrorist propoganda. There are coal fired power plants in the US and China individually releasing as much and more carbon into the atmosphere then the entire oil sands developments combined. Read the article by Ezra Levant titled "Facts oiled up"  	20	2
2015-04-05 11:29:09	Walter White	@ There is some truth to what you say, and as a Canadian I find it disturbing. The reason that 75% of the big mining companies in the world place their headquarters in , is because of our lax laws for control over mining operations. Here in  itself mining operations are monitored to high standards, but there are Canadian owned companies in small foreign country guilty of many abuses to the local people and to their environment.  	38	2
2015-04-05 06:18:12	Stevon Robb	@ That is all propaganda by eco nazi's. As a matter of fact the oil sands are the most ethical oil extraction via sands on the planet. Billions of dollars are spent a year on natural recovery by our government. All the damage that is done is reclaimed by returning the naturual habitat to orginal form. These earth lovers make documentaries on the destruction but fail to say that we have recovered just as much land as we mined in the process. Go have fun with your Fox news and Buzz Feed stupidity.  	20	2
2015-04-05 00:06:10	Rolman80 80	@Doi Ever heard ca oil tar sand no where in this planet there is such horrific destruction being done to mother earth than by canadians you have many many mining drilling companies doing mayor damage across this planet. You are even worst than the ns and that is pretty bad.  	20	2

2015-04-04 15:23:34	Stevon Robb	@ Your comment makes no sense. How is it according to you not a real country?  has one of the highest GDP in the world and supplies the united states with an immense amount of recources and products. That is of course if you even know what GDP is.  also entered both world wars way before  did and we liberated more territories from the Germans than them as well.  	9	0

This sign shows that the water level has not changed since I first saw it. If " Sea levels have been rising at a greater rate year after year...." this sign should be near water level and "another meter would put it under water. Does the sea level not rise in Florida?? I suggest that the IPCC change it's measuring stick.   BB  	31	2
